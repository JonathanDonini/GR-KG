['I watched Lilo & Stitch today... Here are my thoughts', "Holy fuck has the internet been extremely disingenuous to this movie.   \n  \nIt's genuinely a great kids movie. Stitch looks and acts perfect. He's adorable. Lilo's actor Maia Kealoha did a fantastic job.\n\nThe Aliens look great. Super faithful to the movie, though it's a shame we couldn't get Pleakley in drag, Billy Magnussen did an amazing job embodying the character. The movie handles their disguises very well. Zach Galifianakis did great as well\n\nAlso, Grand Councilwoman is hot\n\nPretty much every bad thing I've heard about this movie was a complete lie or drawn in extremely bad faith.  \n  \nThey took out Captain Gantu, and honestly, it was the right decision. Not saying the movie flowed better than the original, but it flowed better in live action translation\n\nThe sister's relationship is extremely heartfelt and done beautifully. You genuinely get sucked into their situation and feel their emotions. Sydney Agudong played Nani perfectly. I would even say this version of Nani is more tragic than the original. You can feel her helplessness\n\n**SPOILER** about Nani & Lilo plot  \n>!I saw on Twitter that Nani gave Lilo away so she could study marine biology, and that's absolutely not true at all. A social worker made visits to see if Nani could take care of Lilo, and she couldn't. So... Nani went to college, and Lilo was given to her Aunti. Thats it.!<\n\nInconclusion, don't get your opinions from the internet. Go outside, see a movie if you want to see it, things aren't black and white.   \n  \nThe internet did this movie an insane injustice. It's a wonderful movie to see with your kids and/or your significant other."]

- ‚ÄúAlso, Grand Councilwoman is hot‚Äù threw me for a loop

    - Hannah Waddingham for her voice alone‚Ä¶recognized her immediately.  She is so good!

        - Rebecca Welton‚Äôs voice is very recognizable. I miss hearing her say small phrases like ‚ÄúOh Ted!‚Äù ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è

            - Looking at a 2026 release date for the Lasso renewal last I heard

                - I don‚Äôt know if I want a renewal. I think it was perfect as is.

                    - Sudeikis and Hunt and co. said they would not make another season unless it added to the story. I'm pretty sure it was a request directly from whoever is running Apple TV+ because they love the show so much. So they took a break to figure out how to write a good 4th season, and I think it will be great.

                - M o r e.  T e d.  L a s s o  !

        - Quite the box office weekend she‚Äôs having being in this and the new MI movie.

        - Please I thought it was Julie Andrews the entire time until I saw the credits lmfao

        - her voice could make anyone melt tbh

    - Yeah lol I don't know whether I want to know more about this or ... maybe I know enough

        - Don‚Äôt worry someone will post a ‚Äúthoughts on grand councilwoman‚Äù post here soon, right between all of the other spank material.

    - Glad i wasn‚Äôt the only one who stopped reading after this.

    - That one line invalidates any and all praiseüòê but sure, it's funny

        - Listen, you‚Äôve got to separate people from their weird fetishes. There‚Äôs definitely someone I respect and admire out there who has some way more niche secret kink I don‚Äôt know about, and at the end of the day, I‚Äôve gotta believe that it doesn‚Äôt change anything. I mean, James Joyce had a thing for farts, but he still wrote Ulysses.

- I haven‚Äôt seen this movie and I‚Äôm very unlikely to, but i want to see more posts that actually discuss movies. Thanks for posting.

    - Thoughts on Christina Hendricks?

        - She has a great set of films

            - She has huge‚Ä¶.tracts of land

                    - But she‚Äôs dying

                - As ‚Äòer own dad, in a very real‚Ä¶.and legally binding sense

                    - why tf are you getting downvotes on that??

it‚Äôs like when i built that huuuggee castle‚Ä¶ and it sank into the swamp.
so i built an even bigger castle! that burned down flipped over and sank into the swamp‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôll get it right this time

                        - I‚Äôve no idea, we live in a bloody swamp!

                - NO SINGING!!!!

        - I think they already said their thoughts on councilwoman?

            - Yeah but we didn't get a cleavage picture for proof.

        - I might be in love with that woman. And for all the wrong reasons.

            - 5 star comment.

        - I felt bad for Crista Flanagan after her Playboy appearance because Playboy had been all coy about saying someone from Mad Men was going to be in the magazine, and the Internet did its usual thing and hyped itself up for Christina to be in the magazine...and then people had to express their opinion on their disappointment.

I mean, c'mon.  That's just rude.

        - She'll get you sent to the special hell.

    - Haven't had interest in a live action Disney movie ever, my partner's fav is Lilo & Stitch so we went opening night.

Movie had heart, was awesome.

    - This feels like the first post I've ever seen from this sub that isn't " what do you think of (insert busty actress here)?"

    - You should see it. It was amazing and all these hates are force.

- [removed]

    - This comment made me very sad, I'll wipe my tears with all of this Disney money I have spread around my bed

        - Just because you weren‚Äôt directly paid by them doesn‚Äôt mean you weren‚Äôt too stupid to fall victim to their gradually right leaning propaganda

            - Right leaning propaganda?

                - I don‚Äôt know if it was deliberate on Disney‚Äôs part, but ‚Äúnative child is better off surrendered to the state‚Äù has rather imperialist connotations. Additionally, depicting Nani as ‚Äúfreed‚Äù to pursue a dream on the mainland (which she didn‚Äôt originally have) has some ‚Äúindividualism > collectivism‚Äù implications.

The ending might seem heartwarming from a western perspective, but it is rather inauthentic to the people it‚Äôs trying to depict.

                    - This is such a stretch you genuinely might be Mr Fantastic. She went to college and had a family friend watch her little sister. It has nothing to do with oppression or surrendering to the state lol.

            - go outside and speak to real people

            - You sound exactly like the far right talking about the "far left propaganda" Disney supposedly had in the movies for decades.

Careful calling the kettle black

                - "How dare you call out colonialist propaganda. You were out here feeding the homeless and preaching how we have to all take care of one another last week! You're an extremist and just as bad!"

- I'm actually glad it got vilified cause i went in today with my daughter and VERY low expectations, so I was able to enjoy it more! 

They ruined Jumba's character, who I loved in the original, by making him a one dimensional evil genius but aside from that, I've seen a lot worse kids movies.

    - I did enjoy that they changed the story enough but I did wish they left jumbo alone.

        - They couldnt leave Jumba alone. When they removed Gantu, they needed someone to be the 3rd act Villian.   
What makes it not well executed is they didnt make any real changes to Jamba scene until the 3rd act where hes suddenly anti family, for some reason.

            - The guy made 626 experiments with the singular goal of causing the most mayhem and destruction possible, and you think it‚Äôs weird for him to be the villain?

                - Most of his experiments were oddly useful failures, as shown in the TV series. They just needed purpose. 

And in the original he flipped to Stitch‚Äôs side with like one line of dialogue between him and Stitch. 

‚ÄúWhat? After all you put me through you expect me to help you just like that? Just like that?!‚Äù

‚ÄúEh!‚Äù

‚ÄúFine!‚Äù

Dude was‚Ä¶ off‚Ä¶ a bit manic, but I don‚Äôt think he was actually evil like he thought he was.

                    - He is very persuasive.

                    - To be fair, he‚Äôd also been watching stitch for a long time. He was changing alongside stitch and when they finally had their confrontation, it made him realize some things. At least that‚Äôs how I felt.

                        - They‚Äôre loose parallels of the Ugly Duckling. Stitch needed a father figure that isn‚Äôt human, and Jumba wanted his experiments to succeed. However; his idea of success slowly changes when he sees that there‚Äôs more to Stitch than just a walking force of destruction.

                - The original movie character arc was him going from villain to loving earth.

                - It's not that him being a villain in the remake is illogical or impossible that's the issue, it's the fact that they implemented it in such a way that it basically happens out of nowhere with little to no build up to it in prior scenes. For vast majority of the 2025 movie, he's the same character he was in 2002 - *when he was never intended to be an antagonist and was written to behave accordingly.* It's jarring to see him suddenly go villain mode when he spent pretty much the entire rest of the movie following his own 'how to end up with the good guys' script from 2002.

TL:DR: Yes, Jumba is the most logical choice for a villain in place of Gantu. But it's still on the writers to adapt his original plot and character arc from 2002 to better suit that new role in the remake, which they failed to do.

                - Yes, but as we have seen in the series before most of them were petty crimes and often didnt perform how Jumba wanted them to. They only got REALLY dangerous the closer we got to Stitch.

                    - I mean is experiment 625 that dangerous?

                        - 625 was meant to be what Stitch ended up being but he has a behavioral error that renders him useless for the most part. But he's just as good as stitch is, as seen in the series, they have the same exact set of powers and strengths and weaknesses.

So yeah Jumba wants to be evil and he has done some dangerous shit, but he's not irredeemably evil unlike the live action movie version.

                            - Ya i understand what he was suppose to be but due to that error he wasn't dangerous. Not trying to flair up some argument just trying to make a funny in refute to the experiments being more dangerous as they culminate to 626 :)

                            - Oh my god I couldn‚Äôt remember who 625 was and it‚Äôs fucking reuben üò≠üò≠

            - Youre right, but they did a dog shit job at it. He seemed more of a villain in the original even though he was the complete opposite. Zach galifanakis (close enough) was a *horrible* pick for Jumba, and they clearly didn't help him with the role. Pleakly was also a huge downgrade in my opinion from the original, but at least he still had a good amount of funny moments. I didn't think about him too much. But Jumba was awful. Even when he was on screen, he had absolutely no presence, and never really seemed like a villain unless you were really paying attention to what he was saying. 

Overall I think the movie was incredibly well-done, but Jumba and Cobra Bubbles were the two massive flunks. They could have completely ditched Cobra Bubbles honestly, he really had no part in this movie. And I think that would have been very easy to do if they played up Jumba's role to what it should have been.

                - Is Agent Bubbles as miscast as he seems in the trailer? Because I saw the trailer and didn't realize he was even in it until I looked it up after, the actor doesn't really look like the character other than bald black guy, and the mustache is a questionable choice.

                    - The animated Cobra Bubbles comes off as the kind of guy who shaves his entire head with a straight razor and wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead on the job without a pristine face and a spritz of his favorite aftershave.

I know these dudes. Mustaches are anathema to them.

                    - He does the Cobra Bubbles voice perfectly, but only a couple of times. Other than that he literally had no role at all that I can think of. He didn't do anything, wasnt the cause of any significant events, wasnt funny or entertaining in any way, and was barely discussed. Im honestly surprised they left him in the movie. Anything he did in this version of the movie could have easily been done by any of the other characters. It's very possible that I totally missed something, I don't pay much attention to plot lines. But I really don't think his character added anything at all to this version

            - It also makes sense as to why Nani could keep Lilo in the original story; Jumba and Pleakley joined the Pelekai household and helped take the pressure off of Nani as Lilo‚Äôs sole caregiver. In the credits it shows that Jumba fixed up the house, the car, and (presumably) took care of Lilo while Nani looked for work.

Their case worker being a retired top-secret government agent who specialized in alien coverups helps, too.

One of the credits photos also shows Bubbles hanging out with them in casual wear so the family is definitely endeared to him.

        - I thought it was incredible how much work went into making sure the voices of the other actors were spot on....and then his voice is just out of place.

        - Maybe im in the minority but i liked the change, jumba in the original is the villian until the last 20 mins. Then he randomly is not and is forgiven by all. The turn never made sense

In this one he is consistent

    - Jumba's voice and character were the weakest link. Second weakest was skinny Cobra Bubbles, who is no longer a social worker and is now a CIA spook.
Third weakest was David, who has no plot relevance and is only acknowledged two or three times in the film. The first half of the film lacked the cohesion of the animated movie and it felt like in between bits had been cut so it was a rapid fire of familiar favorites and powerful moments that sometimes felt unearned. I think if they had taken more risks and deviated from the original more in the first half it could have flowed better. Also David should have been cut from the film entirely.

    - It sounds like they‚Äôre interested in making a sequel so I wonder if they did that to give him room to change in the sequel?

        - Oh they‚Äôre definitely doing a sequel.  They didn‚Äôt show Jumba swiping through the different experiments for no reason.  My 5 year old loves the animated series because of all the different experiments and he got real excited for that one second they showed them.

            - They also directly mentioned experiment 627 and showed him in red so I fully expect them to shoot for a trilogy ending with Leroy and Stitch

                - When Jumba was looking at other experiment prototypes to change Stitch to, he started on an image of Angel!

                - Leroy is 629, not 627.

                - but... a lot of the rest of the experiments are used in the tv show-- which explicitely has gantu, marooned on the island, trying to capture them in order to regain his lost status.

all while having 625 as a roommate/sandwich maker.

how can u have all the other experiments without gantu üò≠

            - There was an experiment that sucked snot out of people‚Äôs noses in the show. I would kill for that experiment to be real.

        - I think they will do Jumba's redemption in the sequel.  It allows them to give him a character arc rather than just have him switched to good, because Stitch asked.

            - But that was such a great bit.

In the first movie, Jumba wasn't really evil to begin with, he just liked the idea of being an "evil genius". So, yeah, he didn't really have an arc of any significance, but that's OK, because he was a side character, and not every character needs an arc. Jumba is one of my favorite parts of the original, and it's sad to me to have him changed in this way. Doesn't mean it isn't fine for people without my attachment to the character, though.

                - Agree. He was a classic mad scientist. He didn't create stitch to accomplish any long term unfulfilled goals. He was just doing it cause he could. Then he caught him because he could ...then he let him go and helped him, just because he could

This quote sums him up pretty good imo...

Pleakley: Oh, good! I was hoping to add theft, endangerment, and INSANITY to my list of things I did today!
Jumba: Ha ha! You too?

    - I was in the same boat. I saw so many videos and posts saying they ruined the movie so I prepped myself, remember I'm probably not the target audience (I saw it in theaters when I was 9 and it's held a place in my heart since) but fortunately I enjoyed myself and found some parts moving, different but not ruined

    - What a waste of Galifinakis

    - They ruined half the characters. Nani in the first one was on her own. It‚Äôs part of what made the struggle for her so much. Now she has a neighbor who at any point before hand could have done what she does at the end of the movie. 

Idk why we had to replace bubbles with someone else. He‚Äôs not really her social worker anymore. 

I could go on. The movie missed the point of the OG one. And as normal with Disney live action remakes at this point. They just stitched a bunch of iconic moments together and didn‚Äôt really bother making it all work well. 

If you enjoyed it then no harm no foul. But I went with my closest sister in age and we were both rather disappointed.

        - ALSO if she really wanted to fight for Lilo.. she definitely could've promised and showed change in lifestyle and still went to college as a single guardian (like many americans)... PLUS COLLEGE IN HAWAII IS FREE FOR NATIVE HAWAIIANS.  They could've made it work if they wrote it well

        - They did that on purpose because Hawaiians said they wouldn't leave two kids alone right after their parents died because they are a community. So they made it more that she was offered help but was stubborn and refusing it. It made more sense for the live action I thought.

        - "[Disney] just stitched a bunch of iconic moments together"


Hey, that's the name of the movie!!

        - It‚Äôs like they told AI to make a live action Lilo and Stitch

        - Yeah- what Auntie? If there was an Auntie then there was no struggle for Ohana. If Ohana was easily available then why was Nani struggling?!

    - I was surprisingly not opposed to making Jumba the villain since it actually makes more sense for Stitch‚Äôs character arc to overcome the evil intentions of his creator rather than a random space officer that was just doing his job.

        - Except a running theme of the first movie was that a lot of their problems stemmed from society not being set up to handle oddball like lilo and stitch. Someone just "doing their job" would have broken up their family

            - Also Jumba is Stitch‚Äôs family

        - The original stitch still had the story arc of overcoming his evil intentions without Jumba being the end villain of the movie. Not sure why you're implying Jumba needs to be the villain for that to happen

    - I‚Äôm less upset about the narrative changes to Jumba, and more bothered by Zach Galifianakis completely phoning it in during every scene.

The casting director clearly made some great choices, and on paper Zach seems like a great fit. But he was just so uncharacteristically deadpan in every scene and it completely killed the original dynamic between Jumba and Pleakley.

        - I honestly didn't know it was Galifiankis the whole movie, I was gonna complain and ask who this temu Galifiankis was only to be shocked that it was actually him. Everything about him was just off.

You can do without the accent and the broken English that's fine, but you still have to do some kind of character work with the voice, it just didn't work

    - That's a bummer. That was one of the best character arcs. Watching him turn from evil villain so loving earth because of Lilo

    - I try to go into any movie with lowest possible expectations

    - Yeah they should‚Äôve made USA CIA guy evil, alien was supposed to be like a quirky Russian scientist absent-minded professor, I always felt like¬†

    - Really wish they left his Russian accent in

    - so many worse films out there! I share you experience with low expectations. I enjoyed the Minecraft movie with my kids too, also super low expectations.

    - They really can't win, because there are tons of people out here screaming for "bring back simply evil characters, not every villain needs to be redeemable"

        - True , but there's probably a difference between making a new evil villain and taking an already redeemed character and then reducing him to an evil villain.

        - There were no evil villains in the original movie.

The Grand Councilwoman was following the law as for genetic experiments and even tried to give Experiment 626 a chance to show he was more than his programming.

Captain Gantu was just trying to do his job. 

Jumba was more morally ambiguous than anything else, yet was fascinated that Experiment 626 could evolve into something more.  

Cobra Bubbles was just trying to make sure everything didn't go sideways on Earth.

        - Yes, but in this case, they removed the truly evil character and then made the evil-but-redeems-himself character truly evil.

            - I'm not sure if he was really evil in the OG.  I always read him as a mad scientist.  More Chaotic Neutral than anything.

                - That's fair.

- It's hard to believe that someone could COMPLETELY misunderstand why people would dislike this remake.

    - yep

    - 100%

    - Can you explain it to me like I‚Äôm five? I am one of the people who think the hate doesn‚Äôt make sense, it was solid remake and they did right by the film but would like to understand the other side.

        - I mean, they didn't really do justice to the initial moral of the story, which was "ohana means family, no one gets left behind."

In the original, Nani is struggling to take care of Lilo by herself. She has a lot of unfair expectations put on her as a teenager. But in the end of the movie, she gets help-- she's intergalactically protected, Jumba and Pleakly are basically live-in help at that point, and she has a village now so that she can breathe and take care of herself while being a guardian for Lilo. She literally created her own Ohana and that's beautiful.

I feel like the original message doesn't stand out anymore and it's just a generic "you do you, girl" movie ending. In the right setting, the ending makes sense and it's more realistic even, but this is Lilo and Stitch we're talking about. It feels unfaithful to the original.

            - >! so like the whole fam they made at the end with David, the aunt, the cobra, pleakly, and Nani with her portal gun? Or does that not count because‚Ä¶? !<

        - I haven't seen the movie but from what I have heard there are two major points against the movie. First, the overall tone about tourism, and second the ending with Nani. 

First, Lilo and Stitch animated had a subtle anti-tourism subplot. Lilo playing pranks on tourists, Nani not liking where she was working but still being forced to do it since there weren't any other options, and the song Nani sings to Lilo was quite literally the same song the last queen of Hawaii sung the night before white US insurgents deposed her.

Second, telling indigenous people to give their family up to the US government is STEEPED in a very horrible history (look up the history of Native American boarding schools. It's dark). Yes the movie sanitized it heavily and made it "work out" in the end,  but the core message is still problematic.

            - ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen the movie but‚Äù pretty much sums up the criticism. People who haven‚Äôt seen it making up some nonsense. I usually hate live action remakes but this one is better than the original. And no she doesn‚Äôt give up her sister to the government in the end ffs

        - Its a blatant cash grab and it cannot compare to the original is probably about 80% of it. What the post details is probably 1%. Hope that helps

            - Disney have been cash grabbing since at least the 90s with sequels (until recently most Disney sequels were straight to VHS/DVD), it's nothing new. That said it was a good, honest to the original, live action remake made for children. They aren't making these movies for Disney adults

- [removed]

    - Well said! Thank you so much for this. The original Lilo and Stitch was subversive and surprisingly so being from Disney.

Do you recall which Lindsay Ellis essay she talked about this?¬†

        - It was the ‚ÄúPocahontas Was a Mistake, and Here's Why!‚Äù essay.

Edit: 

I also was to say that the reason Lilo and Stitch was so subversive and shockingly anti American imperialism is due to the fact that it was made almost in secret at the Florida studio. Executives didn‚Äôt even see it until it was finished at by that time the only thing they had time to rework was one seen where stitch blows up a house due to the then recent 9/11 attacks.

            - THANK YOU! Really about to pull that up on Nebula.¬†

Interesting fact about the creation of the movie! I was the wrong age when it came out (15) and never gave it chance (couldn‚Äôt stand the over saturation of stitch products in Disney parks) until adulthood and was gutted by the emotional core of the two sisters. To hear the live action just‚Ä¶hand waves that is so freaking sad.


¬†But at least cg stitch looks cute I guess. Will definitely sell even more plush.¬†

            - I rewatched the original a couple weeks ago and I was floored by how much more was in the movie than I registered when I was young. As someone who works in social work education now, the struggles Nani (and lilo, in her grief) was dealing with hit differently, and the anti-imperialist themes were not at all registered when I was a kid. I was so surprised as I was watching how many times I went ‚ÄúDisney let them do *THAT*?!??‚Äù and ‚Äúhow did they MAKE this movie?????‚Äù

    - Speaking of "opportunity," it gives me the ick that Nani had to go to the mainland to go to school. I haven't watched the new movie, but I did read that she wanted to study marine biology... there's no way there's not a top-tier program at a Hawaiian university.¬†

        - [deleted]

        - There are multiple and some among the best. Hawaii is one .
My relative does her PhD in marine biology at the University of Hawaii.

        - Last time I was in Maui we did some ‚Äúeco-tourism‚Äù and literally every employee for the tourism company were marine biology students. It was like‚Ä¶ Mecca for marine biologist.

        - The University of Hawaii is one of the foremost marine biology research institutions in the world and the state government offers aid specifically to native Hawaiians to go to college there.

        - Yeah, I‚Äôm from Hawaii and if you want to study most things, you‚Äôre going to find better opportunities on the mainland. But marine biology? UH Manoa has an absolutely top tier marine biology department (she would have to leave Kaua‚Äôi and move to Oahu though).

            - Which, like, doesn't matter when she has the portal gun so the travel and transportation side of things are non-issues. It's like the movie was made with no knowledge on Hawaii itself.

    - The second I heard the sisters didn‚Äôt end together I was opposed to the film. Literally the only thing that people remember about lilo and stitch is ohana means family and family means no one is left behind.

        - My take upon the story is that Tutu, the neighbor / aunt figure, was an active part of Nani's and Lilo's life before the events of this movie, so Lilo staying with Tutu and Nina being able to advance her education while being able to still come and go at will, via the portal gun is a happy ending to me.

The sad truth is if Lilo was truly taken, Nani could NOT see her **SISTER**, Lilo, at anytime for any reason, like she was able to in the ending.  It blows my mind that people expected Nani to drop her life's plan for Lilo, when there was another option for Lilo to be taken care of and Nani and Lilo to see each other at will, unplanned without any courts / case workers butting in.

Its not like Lilo went to a total stranger to Nani and Lilo.   Who is to say that Tutu, David, Nani, and Lilo aren't a family in the end.

I think the biggest thing most people are forgetting is that **Nani** **and Lilo are Sisters**, not mother and daughter.

            - Who tf is Nina?

            - That‚Äôs the whole point though. Sometimes family is hard, sometimes it causes you to sacrifice your goals, sometimes you have to decide between two priorities and pick which is actually important. Your sister who at a young age lost her parents and feels alone or a potential career advancement. 

The beautiful thing was that in the original Nina got it. Without being told or having the movie even focus on it, she knew ohana and that her sister was her priority. She sacrificed, she suffered, but she didn‚Äôt do it because she was forced, she chose the right thing. She was a role model for millions.

    - Yes! Thank you. I couldn‚Äôt figure out exactly why this change made me feel absolutely sick, but this hits the nail on the head. I went from generally positive but not really caring much about the remake (even considering all the other changes made along the way) to feeling like they broke something so integral. The news of this change has genuinely made me upset and all for a remake I never planned to go out of my way to see.

Small and broken, but still good. Nani and Lilo deserve to have their family, their ohana, protected.

The way I heard the social worker described feels so much more insidious and manipulative. Articles describe her as sympathetic to the family and their struggles but ‚Äògently making Nani understand how not ready she is to be her sister‚Äôs guardian.‚Äô

Like- ahhhh. Cobra Bubbles was going to take Lilo away too, but I still believed he had Lilo‚Äôs best interest at heart. He was hard on them, but he still wanted them to convince him they could make it work. 

Using medical debt to take custody of a child and trying to make it seem like the good ending that the sisters aren‚Äôt together just. I need people to get why this is fucked up and wrong.

        - In a way I‚Äôm glad Cobra isn‚Äôt the social worker because I wouldn‚Äôt want him weaponising medical debt against Nani. It‚Äôs an interesting contrast, Cobra Bubbles is this big intimidating outsider but is surprisingly gentle and reasonable, Mrs. Kekoa is more approachable and also means well but she‚Äôs also a bit more ruthless and unforgiving.

            - Mr Bubbles is also not unreasonable, when he finally goes ahead and removes Lilo it's because part of the house blew up when Nani wasn't there with Lilo. When he finds out multiple aliens have been following the family around, interfering with their lives, and even living under the same roof, he accepts that the situation was out of Nani and Lilo's control and not due to Nani being irresponsible or incapable.

                - AND he‚Äôs eager to jump at not having to separate them 

He‚Äôs eager to keep them together if he can

                    - He was even the one who reminded Lilo that Stitch was hers and couldn‚Äôt leave either! Exactly like you said, he wanted *all* of them to stay together.

    - Minor correction, but Aloha ‚ÄòOe **became** symbolic of Hawaii‚Äôs annexation. It was originally written based on Liliuokalani witnessing her friends giving each other a fond farewell embrace. The song was written in 1878, and while the overthrow of Hawaii‚Äôs sovereignty *was* a years-long process, the actual coup overthrowing the government didn‚Äôt happen until 1893.

It doesn‚Äôt take away from your point, but this topic really resonates with me and it was the subject of my essay of choice back in history class.

    - Well said. This just reminds why I'd prefer to watch the original

    - Lilo gets taken in by a neighbor who's shown throughout the movie to be someone who's known and cared for the girls for their whole lives. Lilo isn't stolen by some evil government agency, she moves *next door* to live with someone who's basically an aunt or grandma to her. The change isn't saying "native people should be broken apart"! It's saying that "family" doesn't just have to be biological. It can also be the people around you, friends and neighbors. 

Honestly, a lot of the online outrage feels like it's from wh*te people speaking for actual native Hawaiian people without getting their actual input.

        - People are going to come away from a piece of media with different opinions and interpretations, but in my view, framing the breakup of a Native family due to medical debt, with the youngest placed in any kind of government-overseen foster program, as a happy ending is not something I could justify as well intentioned or well thought out. I am glad they had the foresight to at least have Lilo placed in a foster home she is familiar with, but any breakup of a family, especially after a major trauma such as parental death, is a hard sell.

    - Thank you so much for writing this. Perfectly expresses the reasons why the remake isn't just bad writing but actively a shitty take on a beautiful original.

    - Thank you for saying this. I don‚Äôt think OP understands this view

        - agreed

    - Thank you thank you thank you for putting it into words.¬†

    - But they still sleep in the same bed in the end credit scene. Nani isnt gone forever, but for e few years.

    - This sounds like a grumpy screenwriter was not happy with Nani having to take care of Lilo...but that unfairness is kinda a key part of the original movie...and I dunno why they changed something like that when it represents a bunch of families who love each other. Meh

        - It is a very white feminist take. I didn‚Äôt like how they also put it on Lilo, a six year old, to give her older sister ‚Äúpermission‚Äù to leave and pursue her future. It reeks of wanting to avoid parentifying a barely adult young woman but in doing so it also seems rather selfish and doesn‚Äôt honor the thousands of unique family structures throughout the world who function in loving and supportive homes.

            - If they wanted to have Nani attend college (which, btw, was never OG Nani‚Äôs dream: it‚Äôs implied she wanted to be a pro surfer in the cartoon), surely they could have attend college in HI. There are many world-renowned marine biology programs there. She could balance the two with the help of David and his family (and Pleakley and Jumba tbh if they hadn‚Äôt turned him into the main villain)

You‚Äôre right. It feels super white feminist-y

            - I agree with your point, but downvoted for racism.

            - The screenwriter is a Native Hawaiian born and raised in Hawaii. Not sure how that fits into your narrative but maybe he just had a different perspective on life growing up here.

                - We also have to consider that the live-action movie remakes involve considerably more executive input and production meddling than the original films. In fact, the original Lilo and Stitch was made almost entirely without executive involvement, since it was developed nearly in secret at the Florida studio. By the time it was finished, the only revision they had time for was one scene where Stitch blows up a house, which was changed because the executives didn‚Äôt want anything that might resemble the 9/11 attacks.

                    - Yes, it‚Äôs hard to determine exactly who made what decisions regarding specific parts of the plot. I just see a lot of people blaming the screenwriter for not understanding the original movie or similar sentiments (not you specifically). I‚Äôm pretty sure he has more knowledge about Hawaii and its culture than anyone commenting here consider where he grew up and went to school.

    - What do you mean under the supervision of a government social worker? Isn't it their also native neighbors?

    - I‚Äôm sorry did you entirely miss the part when Nani sings Aloha Oe in the hammock to Lilo? Did we watch different movies? I‚Äôm fairly certain I didn‚Äôt hallucinate that scene or the room full of 5-10 year olds weeping. 

Are all of these critiques just AI written based off of internet assumptions?

Compared to the garbage Minecraft movie this was a gem.

    - Respectfully you one local? Bc really so much of this complaint and ones like it seem to be coming from people who haven‚Äôt actually seen the movie. Like, one of the biggest criticisms is that Nani ‚Äúabandons‚Äù Lilo‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just not true. In the remake, Nani goes to college to study marine biology, which is a huge opportunity for her and ultimately a better future for both of them. And she¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†leave Lilo behind emotionally or relationally‚Äîshe literally steals a¬†portal gun¬†so she can keep visiting her. That‚Äôs not abandonment, that‚Äôs commitment.

Also, this version gives Nani something the original didn‚Äôt: a clearly defined dream. In the OG, her goals were more of a background detail, something she had to sacrifice. But here, she‚Äôs a young woman with ambition in STEM, trying to leave her small town and make a better life‚Äînot just for herself, but¬†for Lilo too. That‚Äôs incredibly relatable, especially for local girls growing up in Hawai‚Äòi who often feel stuck between family obligation and personal dreams.

And another key difference: in this version, the community actually steps up to support her. The neighbors take Lilo in¬†because¬†they understand Nani‚Äôs doing this for the long run. That kind of communal support was mostly missing in the original, and its inclusion here adds another layer to the whole theme of ‚Äòohana.

Also, people keep saying the film doesn‚Äôt understand the heart of the original, but the message is still there‚Äîjust evolved. The remake even expands on it by making it clear that ‚Äúmoving forward doesn‚Äôt mean leaving yourself behind.‚Äù That‚Äôs a beautiful, updated take on what it means to be part of a family when life pulls you in different directions.

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif this had been a shot-for-shot remake like¬†The Lion King, people would still complain. But this version actually tries to say something¬†new¬†while respecting the emotional core of the original. That should be something we appreciate, not nitpick before watching.

    - She doesn't stay with government social worker. She stays with a family friend. 

But yes, modern live action Disney is much more conservative and colonialist than earlier animated Disney. But let's also not pretend that megacorp 90s/early 00s Disney wasn't still an evil megacorps.

    - She literally sings that song to Lilo and plays the ukulele the night before she‚Äôs supposed to be taken in the remake, what are you talking about?

    - ????? They didn‚Äôt remove the song. Nani sings it on the hammock. Did you watch the movie?

    - What movie did you watch? ¬†Nani sings Aloha Oe to Lilo on the hammock in a very emotional scene. It wasn‚Äôt left out. ¬†Lilo is staying with her neighbor who is considered Ohana. ¬†Nani attends one of the best Marine Biology schools in the US instead of staying in Hawaii and struggling her whole life at dead end jobs. ¬†Plus with the portal gun she can see Lilo and Stitch every day. ¬†You were really looking hard to find reasons why the movie wasn‚Äôt Native enough. ¬†

    - I do want to give you major credit for the Hawaiian history breakdown and the correlation between Aloha Oe and the scene shown. However, I do feel like this version is a little more in tune with reality and the happy ending the original was trying to portray. I think you really have to understand the culture of Hawaii to understand where the film was going here. I feel like you did a lot of research and really invested into this theory so I just wanted to throw this perspective out there as someone born and raised in Hawaii. 

In Hawaii, ‚Äúit takes a village‚Äù is taken a lot more literally than metaphorically. Especially if you‚Äôre actually from a village üòÇ Keiki are treated as not only a parent‚Äôs responsibility, but as the communities as well. We call complete strangers Aunty and Uncle in Hawaii as a sign of respect. A next door neighbor would definitely be a realistic option for a child to go to who had roots in the community. Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind. BUT ‚Äî In Hawaii communities of people have stronger bonds with one another and create ohana regardless of a blood connection. Family does not mean ‚Äúblood relationship‚Äù in Hawaii ‚Äî in fact I would argue that it has way more of a correlation to the translation of community. I have a big blood family in Hawaii. I would have to start questioning a loooot of people if I wanted to differentiate between my calabash cousins and my real life blood cousins. All of them are just cousins to me tbh ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a normal experience there. 

A lot of kids in Hawaii either have the college dream or the hotel and hospitality dream. You want to give them the ending where Nani stays? Ok. She stays. She finds a full time job at a hotel living in a shack paycheck to paycheck while they‚Äôre on a Hawaiian homes list for ten years plus. It‚Äôs not the happy ending Disney is looking for. The real dream is the kids who get out, get themselves a good education, come home to spread their knowledge, and help the economy there with higher paying jobs. Hawaii kids come back. It‚Äôs part of our blood. Other places around the world feel alien-like, there is no sense of aloha.

If they wanted to make Nani a mediocre character, they would have done what they had done in the original. The sacrificial lamb who gives up her life for Lilo. Instead of stepping in and becoming her mother, she is able to have her own dreams and still be a supportive sister. It‚Äôs a lot more in tune with what would realistically happen there for both Nani and Lilo‚Äôs best interests because the community is there to step in and look after one another. Ohana. NOBODY gets left behind. 

Personally, I like this ending a lot more.

        - It‚Äôs unfortunate that you‚Äôre being downvoted for sharing your opinion/take as someone actually born and raised in Hawaii, likely with a more nuanced grasp of the community dynamics there than those downvoting you.

            - It‚Äôs okay, just by reading some of the comments agreeing with this I can tell they‚Äôve never been a part of the local community here. Comments like ‚Äúit‚Äôs Hawaii ‚Äî there have to be better marine science opportunities at universities there‚Äù (There aren‚Äôt. UH manoa is great but it has a very competitive program that‚Äôs hard to get into AND expensive compared to schooling in the mainland  ‚Äî Hawaii has all of three universities TOTAL across the islands). Some kids get super lucky and get to go to a local school but for most of us the dream is to get out and see the world a little and then come back home. 

Regardless, the sense of Ohana is very strong and it‚Äôs within the community ‚Äî not from family to family. For example [here is a story](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ8VRO3xqmA/?igsh=Z2d0ZjVwbGN6ZjF0) that happened recently that showcases the ideals and sense of community there. To me, that‚Äôs what Ohana is really about.

                - They dont even have to be local. If you go onto r/Hawaii, discussions like this happen on the regular. 

Its not that hard to read and try to understand. People arr weird.

        - They named the neighbor lady Tutu, FFS. Clearly she was meant to be a familial figure.

        - Agreed, kinda sick of all these people complaining about a remake with a different perspective that isn‚Äôt just all sunshine and rainbows. Especially when they don‚Äôt know anything about growing up here. Like

    - I guess now I can‚Äôt say for sure what the song is. But there is a scene in the live action of them in the hammock singing together the night before she‚Äôs supposed to be taken, just like in the animated version.

And she stays with the neighbor (family friends), not with a state foster while Nani goes to school.

        - But she is still in foster care which, even if she is with family friends, is still under government oversight.

    - Thank you for this.  

Also, I heard Disney was subtly promoting their new hotel on the island in the movie.  Couple this with the fact that a very small portion of the population living on the islands are of indigenous Hawaiian ancestry (something like less than 10%) and that many have been displaced to the mainland because tourism and the US military has literally displaced them from their homes

    - Yikes. I hate that new ending. What an awful way to change up ‚ÄúLilo & Stitch.‚Äù I guess I‚Äôll skip the new one.

- I am Mexican but my family is Hawaiian. The original movie was great once they explained all the things I didn‚Äôt understand because I am not part of the culture. The new one took a lot out in the name of making it more palatable for other people and with that ruined for Hawaiians. Does that matter? Yes and no. Yes because it erases parts that Hawaiians really connected with and no because it‚Äôs made for a global audience and Hawaiians are an extremely tiny minority. If you like it cool if you don‚Äôt cool too. One thing to consider is that if you are Hawaiian and decide to study marine biology Hawaii is one of the better places to do it based on the fact that is an island in the middle of the ocean plus native Hawaiians get the tuition paid. Which makes lani giving lilo up pointless.

- I didn‚Äôt love the change. I get it though and it was a good message for young girls. Idk though, there was something special about Nani NOT getting a happy normal ending in the OG. It showed that life isn‚Äôt perfect and the best ending is sometimes just staying together and struggling. It gave the realism and heart so many other Disney movies lack. This one felt‚Ä¶. just like another happy perfect Disney ending. It lacked heart for me but it‚Äôs what people want when they go to see Disney.

    - Nani does get a happy ending in the og lol, they build her a brand new house!

        - She gets the house, the hot guy, and gets to go travel on vacation in the og. Sounds pretty happy to me.

            - And under intergalactic protection!

            - And college is free in hawaii for native hawaiians. She could still go to school to become a marine biologist while keeping lilo. Since when does having a kids mean you can't go to school?¬†

            - Does she not get to stay with David in this one???

                - David stays in Hawaii and helps raise Lilo with his grandmother.

    - I‚Äôve been trying to put into words why I dislike this ‚Äúhappy‚Äù ending so much and you put it perfectly. My family struggled with poverty my entire childhood and now all us siblings live and rent together and as ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and messy as our little family is, it‚Äôs ‚Äústill good.‚Äù  I always connected with the group forming some messy but wonderful and connected family together that sticks together no matter the storm. Now they don‚Äôt. They get this picture perfect Disney dream ending, and so many of us don‚Äôt get that. We get what they got in the original film and felt reflected in that ending.  Now that‚Äôs gone in favor of Disney‚Äôs sanitized, picture perfect ‚Äúgoing away to college like young adults should‚Äù ending. Idk. It just reeks to me.

        - It erases the normal families that struggle. Life doesn‚Äôt need to be cookie cutter perfect to have perfect meaning. That was what the original movie meant to me.

            - Yes!! Like why does Nani need to be "special smart"? Wasn't she enough before? Wasn't she amazing and strong and smart in the original movie? Like, us regular poors can be good people too.

            - Exactly. And I appreciated that so much more at the time than I realized

        - What I‚Äôd really like to know is who gets custody of Lilo till she‚Äôs 18? The neighbors? Because that to me doesn‚Äôt feel like ohana at all. And agree on the ‚Äúsanitized‚Äù feel of the ending, it just didn‚Äôt hit me right.¬†

        - not to mention, THEY COULD HAVE KEPT THE UNIVERSITY THING WHILE SHE HAS CUSTODY OF LILO!!! nani is native hawaiian, they get to study at university for FREE and hawaii has the BEST programmes for marine biology!!

many adults go to university while still looking after children. they literally could have had that, with the trusted adults in nanis life helping look after lilo when shes working / going to school, without giving her up into foster care

native hawaiians, particularly girls, are disproportionately victims of violent and sexual crime. this is not something to advocate for.

it almost ends up pushing the message that if kids are too much to handle, them being put in foster care is a GOOD THING that benefits the adults to essentially abandon them. a lot of kids who were in foster care left cinemas crying because of what they did.

this isnt to mention everything they took out of the movie that was anti-tourism... changing the white guy to be a native hawaiian as if the whole point of that guys character was to do with too many tourists

            - Yeah exactly. Idk this fucks me up sm. It feels so cold-hearted on Disney‚Äôs part.

        - I agree with this

    - But it wasn‚Äôt just happy. Yes she went to school which is good but Lilo lost her sister and her parents. She wanted her sister but was willing to be a little selfless and push her to be better.

    - People are just trying to make positivity out of being a kids movie. Sure people are going to like it especially those who really care about what changes they make in movies, most people just go along with what they get and what everybody approves of....in a nice act kind of sense. I think most people were expecting the same movie maybe with only changes in animation and a slightly different look on how things happened. But a whole different story compared to the original? Which was a good movie. Who would want to get up and go out to watch a different remake of a good movie? You're right about the ending to the original as well though.

    - this one. i always think back to someone who said lilo and stitch was for the weird kids. what i loved the movie as a child is how the entire family seemed like pieces of broken pictures coming together to make a beautiful little collage. it‚Äôs not a picture perfect ending but it felt very real and still very happy. it sucks to have that changed.

i do understand like you said, how it‚Äôs a good message to young girls‚Äîbut it did feel like changing the core of nani‚Äôs character, and at that point idk, just make another movie with the character you want to make?

my gripes with it are super petty considering it‚Äôs a kids movie, but lilo and stitch was my favorite movie as a kid and there‚Äôs still a special place for it in my heart. i can acknowledge i would have hated any changes they made to what i already consider to be a perfect story though

- The ending with Nani and Lilo should‚Äôve remained the same as the original. It‚Äôs a kids movie, it doesn‚Äôt need to be realistic. I think that‚Äôs a large part where the criticism is coming from. That and the fact that it‚Äôs a blatant shallow cash grab.

    - But how else are you to install pro government ideas in people.

- Your summary of Nani giving away lilo is terrible. It was a horrible decision.

    - Yeah isnt their summary also not totally telling the truth?   Wikipedias Plot Summary says that it still was Nanis decision to give up Lilo


‚ÄúAfter Lilo's recovery, Kekoa tells Nani the Hawaiian government can cover the health insurance costs if she relinquishes her guardianship, which she reluctantly agrees to.‚Äù 


Sure the decision isnt because she wants to go study marine biology, but it also isnt because she cant take care of Lilo.  She could have tried, but instead took the offer to let the Social Worker take Lilo to pay for the Health Insurance


Also Lilo was NOT given to the ‚ÄúAunti‚Äù (the neighbor), she was given to the Govt Social Worker who would have put Lilo with who knows what kind of people.   


It wasnt until the very end of the movie that the Social Worker changes her mind and decides to give Lilos Guardianship to the neighbors, so that Lilo can stay home



If Lilo didnt run away then she would have just been taken away.   But because she ran way she got caught up with Stitch‚Äôs Hijinks again, and when she returned the Social Worker had a change of heart and allowed her to live with the neighbors.



When Nani gave up Lilo it was to get Lilo Health Insurance through the Govt, but she did not know who Lilo would be going to live with. And it would not have been the Neighbors, because they were only chosen after the Social Worker had a change of heart at the end of the movie.

        - OP phrased the ending like it was a small detail and people are crying for no reason. The live action ending changes the entire theme of the original movie and frames it like a good thing.

            - Your first sentence gives away their entire reason for writing this review. They were practically seething that people didn't like a movie they liked even though the (anecdotal evidence of) negative comments I've seen often specifically pointed to the social worker and Nani looking to move to California and how they undermine a lot of what made the original so soulful

            - Ohana means i give u away and use portal gun to see u

        - And any research into Indigenous history would also explain why this is such a terrible decision.


I'm glad this leaked, because I probably won't see it because of this.¬†


Sure it's a kids movie but the underlying issues were truly what made a lot of people connect to it.¬†

        - So she can either have custody of her sister or her sister can have health insurance? What an orphan crushing machine

- We don‚Äôt need more Disney remakes.

    - We didn‚Äôt need any, now we defo don‚Äôt need more 

I keep shuddering at the fact that we got a Moana sequel like 6y after the original, while at the same time they‚Äôre filming a live action of the original Moana‚Ä¶ like what? why??

    - I just find the very concept of these remakes so insulting. It's not even a matter of things being butchered or  bad, it could be technically as good as the original and I would still find it shitty because why are you remaking it in live action in the first place? Some people seem to act like it's perfectly fine to just want a story retold in live action but like why? what was wrong with the animated version that merits a live-action retelling? I think it's very telling that you basically never see anyone say the reverse, you never see someone watching idk Hunger Games and they're like "this would be so cool animated though". The overall attitude that surrounds these movies carries the very strong implication that animation is somehow inherently lacking and illegitimate as an artform and that these otherwise good stories are somehow held back by animation and that by bringing them into live action it legitimizes them and I find that attitude highly objectionable. I say this as someone that enjoys plenty of live-action media I just also see animation as a legitimate artform on its own and I don't think a live-action remake really is even capable of adding anything of merit to justify its existence. If you aren't gonna say John Wick should be remade in animation then don't say HTTYD should be remade in live action.

        - On the contrary, I‚Äôd love to see an (adult) animation of THG that is more brutal and faithful to the books. I think they did a really good job with adapting it to the big screen, but you do lose a lot of the brutality from the books as they wanted to present it to a wider audience.

- Nah they ruined the whole fucking plot of the og by Nani giving up lilo, don‚Äôt defend these shills

- Is it true that Nani gives up Lilo though? I heard from a creator this is the case and it made me not want to watch

    - Part of what the live action director failed to understand about Nani in the OG film was that Lilo was never the problem, Lilo didn‚Äôt stand in the way of her dreams, it‚Äôs that Nani didn‚Äôt have the support she needed from her community to help raise Lilo. She got that support and love in the end. Also, Jumba and Pleakly become pseudo aunt and uncle. With Jumba being the forever bad guy in the live action, no gantu either, this doesn‚Äôt happen.

        - Ugh, I was going to watch it because the little girl looked so much like Lilo, but reading this is off putting. What‚Äôs the message of the movie if the sisters don‚Äôt end up together.

        - This is what is driving me crazy about the people who "don't understand" the issue with the ending. The ENTIRE moral of the original was "ohana means family, no one gets left behind." Nani couldn't take care of Lilo ***by herself,*** and in the end she gets the village that she so desperately needed in Jumba and Pleakley and even the intergalactic force. She created her own Ohana and that's what made the ending so special. Her giving away Lilo completely contradicts the message of the original, and in doing so, is an unfaithful remake.

            - THANK YOU.

        - It's so "white Hollywood feminism" coded, because their answer isn't drawing support from your community, it's giving your family to the state so you can pursue your career. Which feels very anti-Ohana.

            - The craziest thing is, there‚Äôs a really great school for marine biology in Hawaii.. but she had to go to Cali?

                - Anyone who has been to San Diego knows how high the cost of living is there. UC eats low income scholarship students alive because "full ride" doesn't include room and board - you need student loans.

                - I thought the same thing. She could have gone to a university in Hawaii instead

        - "Forever the bad guy"¬†


I have FAITH that with a sequel¬†
(I mean this will obviously be a success for Disney so its inevitable at this point)
That Jumba will get a redemption arc and get back into Lilo's "Ohana", while it can introduce the next to bad guys, being Dr Hamsterviel and Gantu.

    - It's true; and people can play it as a "well she has to" type of thing but... she really didn't.¬†

    - Yeah I‚Äôm hard passing it too

- About your spoiler:

That's literally what people are talking about. The whole point of the original movie was that not happening at all no matter what. Now there's a happy Disney-fied super secret safe button! That takes away from the story.

It's like Myrtle. Sure she got attacked but it's a super secret safe button.

It's... Sanitized.

    - It‚Äôs beyond sanitized, it‚Äôs sinister. The state has stolen indigenous children away from their families for generations as part of the settler colonial project and now that horrifying process is a Disney-fied happy ending? Yikes

    - They even change the scene where Lilo bites Nani and makes her lick her instead. Like biting would be too violent.

- Watched it last night. I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy it nor dislike it. The movie just kind of ‚Äúwas‚Äù of that makes any sense.  
  
I don‚Äôt think there was anything excellent about it but it had its strong points with casting (Nani, lilo and Pleakley).   
  
Taking captain Gantu out I don‚Äôt think was the right decision and making  Jumba‚Äôs character one dimensional kind of hurt it also.   
One of my favourite scenes in the animated film is when Jumba decides to help stitch and his Ohana.   
  
Also Zach Galifanakis was not the the right fit. I think he did the best he could but that was bad casting. And on a even less important note it looks like he got the Hollywood veneer job on his teeth which was distracting. Not sure why big extremely white teeth is the go to.  
  
I never really got sucked in emotionally to their situation. I suppose the broken system assessment was fair seeing as the state would pay for everything as long as they weren‚Äôt together.   
Which was weird as most of the issue was Nani having to work so much to make ends meet.  
  
Overall serviceable film.

    - > One of my favourite scenes in the animated film is when Jumba decides to help stitch and his Ohana.

He‚Äôs very persuasive‚Ä¶

        - Eh!

    - Urg, Im glad Im not the only one that feels that way about Zack. Missing the accent kinda killed it for me.

    - I felt the same way about his teeth! I thought maybe was for an alien look but realized it‚Äôs just like you said‚Äî just a Hollywood ‚Äúupdate‚Äù

    - This is exactly how I feel about it. There was things I really enjoyed and felt added to the original, and there were things that felt really off and drew me away. Overall, I liked it. It just‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt make my heart glow in any way? Like the original did.

- But in the OG she fought so hard for her sister. It's a slap in the face to the OG. And there are little things like the ice cream guy and drag that make the movie better

- Saw it today with my daughters and we all loved it!  There were lots of people dressed in Stitch clothes and with Stitch stuffies.

    - It really felt like an event film with how many kids dressed up. At the end of the movie there was probably 20-30 kids dancing to the end credits song in front of the big screen.

        - That happened at our screening too!

        - I'm 50 and I wore a stitch T-Shirt. So there's that. I met my wife 10 years ago and we were both stitch fans. The movie is our love language to this day.

    - My daughter is already planning on taking her Stitch stuffy with her! She is so excited. Glad to hear your daughters enjoyed it!

    - My daughter went in her stitch onesie. There were a lot of other kids that were jealous üòÇ

- I will not watch any live action adaptation of a perfectly fine original

    - Yeah I will never understand this fascination with seeing the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù version of a ‚Äúkids film.‚Äù Why do animated movies have to be secondary to live action? Disney of all companies should have championed their animation above anything else.

Like the Oscars, for example. If Spider-verse is the best film to come out that year, why is it relegated to the ‚Äúbest animated‚Äù category and not ‚Äúbest picture‚Äù? It‚Äôs an insult to everyone who works on animated films.

        - For a company that grew their reputation on a half-century of animation, Disney really loves to treat animation like it‚Äôs exclusively for kids or for experimental anthology.

        - Many of us actually think animation is a superior medium for telling certain stories.

        - it's because in the west, older adults have been trained to believe that animation isn't only a medium for deep, thoughtful stories, but entertainment only for kids, or inferior to the mature and thoughtful  medium of live action. this view has been held by judges of the oscars for almost as long as it has existed. disney, unfortunately has execs who probably have this or at least a similar view, outside of the other obvious problems.

            - There's a lot of adults who think this way, especially men but not exclusively men. I work in a warehouse, and even trying to convince some of them to watch an adult animated show like Invincible is impossible because they see any "cartoon" as for children or adult virgins.

It's a completely warped viewpoint, but the reality of the situation is that Disney sees it as an untapped market. These live action remakes aren't to appeal to those of us who actually understand that animation can do things and tell stories in ways that live action simply.. can't; they are there for the people who say "I'd never watch that Lion King for babies, but live action lions singing, dancing and acting like people? Hell yeah I'll pay $20 a ticket to see that." 

It's asinine if you ask me, but they must see some financial incentive to it even with poor reviews.

    - Especially because like many of these originals  the original animated Lilo and Stitch is a legit masterpiece of visual art with its sophisticated hand drawn animation and watercolor backgrounds. I just don‚Äôt see how turning these expressively animated characters into stiff CG models is an upgrade.

        - None of it is an upgrade. It isn't that at all
. To understand this shit, you have to think like an executive. It's them doing cost savings by selling the same script twice. And then reselling existing merchandise.

It's them being extremely efficient and making as much as they can out of their brand.

    - I just hope they'll never touch Emperor's New Groove... There's no improvement to perfection. Not to imply live action versions "improved" any of the other movies.

        - The original Lilo & Stitch was perfect as well, but here we are.

        - God‚Ä¶.can you imagine? That movie is balanced so delicately in ‚Äúhad every reason to be a disaster, but somehow turned out to be amazing‚Äù territory. I shudder to think how they would absolutely destroy it.

            - Oh, that's easy. The whole cast will be all American people from mexican or Puerto Rican ancestry that look brown enough, but the movie will be mostly filmed in Peru and Mexico (because Peru and Mexico are sooo similar. They have... Jungles), remove all references to anything pop culture-y (the restaurant scene? Deleted), but you know, without adding anything that will make the movie look too exotic. The llama will become an alpaca because those are cuter and nobody knows the difference anyways, and Izma's plans will not include poison or murder, only vague references to a "permanent retirement"

Ah, and Kuzco has to have a romantic interest. Preferably one that will take some of Pacha's non-comedic, wiser lines. Maybe one of the girls who were Kuzco's prospective wives, but with an added tragic backstory that makes Kuzco reflect and fall in love with her, and after Izma is transformed into a itty bitty kitten that may or may not fart a lot, they don't marry, but get into a committed relationship that breaks Social Conventions‚Ñ¢ or something.

                - Excuse me, I am agent Kool McKool of the movie protection agency. We're going to have to ask you to redact your comment to keep Disney from getting ideas, because this is exactly what they'd do.

                - You forgot thr part where someone takes a potion that inexplicably turns them into a screaming goat for two minutes for the laughs

        - That llama will be bighmare fuel.

    - Yep. I really loathe live action remakes. Even if they are good, it's still a soulless cash grab imo

    - You dont want to watch the exact same movie again, but with a worse story?

    - This is the perfect response to every one of these movies.

    - I really felt they did it a disservice here. Lilo & stitch was perfectly good and had all the proper antics of being a cartoon. This just didn‚Äôt work for me and it felt cringey at points, it really bummed me out. Kids will love it, but I did try to enjoy it, I just couldn‚Äôt get into it.

I‚Äôm sure any live action adaptation after Snow White that doesn‚Äôt do as horrendously bad is a win for Disney.

    - Especially How to Train Your Dragon. The original is fantastic and this live action remake looks like a fan film or something. It‚Äôs weird that people are excited for it

- Sorry boss, I can tell the way this was written your soul was crushed long ago and that your opinion on this movie is tied to ‚Äúkid liked it‚Äù, which as we all know, kids will literally watch anything with colors and movement. 

It even reads like ‚Äúyea they cut a bunch of stuff that was important to the original* and it‚Äôs* worse in every way, but go see the slop, your kid will love it‚Äù!

* some edits

- But it was really necessary other than to make money?  The original is a really good movie

    - Whatever your view is on the remake, the simple fact of the matter is that Disney went back on their message from the first movie. The entire remake is to stress that they don‚Äôt think tourism is bad anymore. They don‚Äôt think the government is responsible for the lack of support Nani and Lilo had. They have a resort in Hawaii now and they want to make money. This is purely a money grab and a disgusting one at that. Removing core storyline points and changing and erasing characters also changed the narrative. It might be okay standalone but if you know anything about Hawaiian culture you more than likely wouldn‚Äôt support this movie.

- I saw the movie and completely disagree, sorry. It was soulless compared to the original. ¬†

Only decent Disney live actions so far have been Aladdin and Little Mermaid, which is ironic since the latter received so much hate for only a skin color change.

    - I also very much enjoyed Kenneth Branagh‚Äôs Cinderella

        - I know I‚Äôm in the minority but the Cinderella one is the only one I actually enjoyed. Some aren‚Äôt bad, but for the rest of them I would just watch the original. But I could see picking up the live action Cinderella over the animated one.

    - Nah I think Cinderella is the only worthy remake. It didn‚Äôt just remake the cartoon, it added its own stuff.

    - Thank you!!!!

The little mermaid is my favorite Disney princess so I was prepared to abhor the remake. It was actually great! The changes they made ADDED to the characters‚Äô development while staying faithful to the original story. It was charming, cute and well-done. Very few people seem to be willing to admit that because they hate the ‚Äúrace swap‚Äù of a freaking mythical creature. 

Lilo and Stitch is my favorite non-princess Disney movie and it‚Äôs disheartening how soulless the remake is and how it completely misses the original moral of the story. 

It‚Äôs also such a bad faith argument to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie for kids; don‚Äôt expect much and it‚Äôs not for you anyway!‚Äù Firstly, because children deserve good movies with emotional intelligence too. And secondly, because it IS for me. It‚Äôs a nostalgia-based cash grab at people who grew up with the original just as much as it‚Äôs a movie for the new generation. Pretending that isn‚Äôt true is just disingenuous.

- Yeah. I went and saw this yesterday and really liked it. The only good live action adaptation since Jungle Book. When I read people‚Äôs takeaways from it I swore they had to have seen a different movie.

    - That‚Äôs a statement. I‚Äôve always felt jungle book aas their best live action adaptation. Been downhill since. Now I‚Äôm curious about this.

        - I heard Cinderella the great LA princess film, but you also never hear about it at all for some reason.

        - The only thing I didn't like about the Jungle book was the ending. that seems a complaint about a lot of these remakes lol

        - Same. Jungle book was amazing and the only one I loved. Didn‚Äôt like any others

    - I am now feeling inspired to watch this. Because so far the Jungle Book is the only live action adaptation I‚Äôve enjoyed.

        - 101 Dalmatians with Glenn Close is goated but no one wants to acknowledge that one for some reason

            - Completely different situation, that movie is almost 30 years old.

                - Tbf, we don‚Äôt know if the other person meant the LA jungle book from the 2010s or the LA jungle book from the early 1990s üòÖ

    - Reading these comments ‚Ä¶.. man some people are way too critical, makes me think they‚Äôd be awful to be around in real life haha. It was one of their best remakes in my opinion. I didn‚Äôt mind the changes. It was cute.

    - Its a netflix series, but I really appreciated the live action of One Piece!

- I didn‚Äôt bash it or anything, but I don‚Äôt even care if it is a good movie. There is a beautiful animation movie, then no need to make a live/CGI remake, period. It‚Äôs pointless.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the Dragons movie.

    - Yes!!!! The HTTYD movie looks so pointless. Literally a frame for frame remake but with actors and CGI. I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills.

    - This is exactly how I feel. The original is a masterpiece in my opinion and I have no interest in seeing this.

- I‚Äôm simply upset with the ending. It seriously flies against the original ohana message of the original. Frankly I‚Äôm sick of the lazy live action adaptations of beloved movies, and I‚Äôm not going to give this one a pass especially considering how they changed the plot. It was a 3/10 for me.

    - I don't understand why people are so upset about the ending. That woman to which Lilo is temporarily given IS ohana. And lilo wasn't left behind since they still see each other often through the portal thing. I really think the original message is still there, and I'm saying that as a huge fan of the original

- And let not forget when Nani contemplated on just letting stitch drown like wtf was that

- "They took out Captain Gantu, and honestly, it was the right decision." stopped reading after this.¬†

- Family means nobody gets left behind‚Ä¶.. unless it‚Äôs live action

    - Nobody gets left behind... unless you are given a Chekhov's gun that will conveniently teleport you to your loved ones with no consequences whatsoever whenever you want where ever you want.

    - Nobody gets left behind unless you are a Strong Female Career Woman. Then it's okay to abandon family.

- For me, the quality of the film is largely irrelevant. The problem is the premise of remaking beloved animations in the first place. At best it's an exercise in pointlessness, and at worst it's a spit in the face. So happy the failure of Snow White has reportedly put a stop to it.

- So ohana means you can get left behind.

- ‚ÄúSuper faithful to the movie‚Äù lol what is the point of this

- Just seen it and this is a very fair take. My only gripe is the payed down the evilness of the grand council. They felt a lot more menacing in the cartoon and I liked that as it felt natural. Whereas they felt like a deliberate softening for today. Not everyone needs to be so wholesome and loving.

- They butchered jumbas voice so incredibly bad it dropped my score from an 8.5/10 to a 7/10. The fact they didn‚Äôt even get his patented laugh had me heated. Rest of the movie was really good and very close to original.

- Definitely not super faithful Zack galifianakis did a bad job they did Jumba so wrong in this movie getting rid of gantu was the nail in the coffin

- I agree with pretty much everything you said but I think the ending controversy is 100% justified why would you have a movie who's entire identity is about a small and broken but still good family weathering everything that comes their way and making through it and somehow change that into the family is fine auntie can just take care of you. I feel like regardless of everything else the simple fact that auntie was always there and able to help just ruins the movie. Why does Nani need to get a job? Why does Nani need to be in good graces with the social worker? Why is Nani wanting to go to college even a debate? There's no suspense over whether or not Lilo will stay with her Ohana because auntie was there and will be there. The whole conflict in the original was that Nani was Lilos only family that's why it was so important they stayed together.

- Still sounds like they shit all over Ohana means family.

- Ohana means give your sister away so you can go to college

    - Why couldn't she just do online college!?!?

        - She owns a portal gun now, there's really no such thing as "being far away" for her anymore. Everywhere on the planet (and then some) is shown canonically to be one trigger pull away.

- It's not faithful to the film. You can say you like the film without lying.

- Enough of the remakes.

- What a wildly incorrect and inconsistent opinion. Even in your spoiler comment stating she didn't give her up, and then saying she did give her up.

Such a terrible adaptation of the movie. Completely spits in the face of the originals message. "ohana means family. Nobody gets left behind or forgotten". But then the message delivered at the end is "maybe leave your sister behind. She's just holding you back anyway!".

Disgusting.

- Why even in the pictures where youre trying to tell us that the movie is actually fine does every cgi character look like absolute garbage?

- I just really hate the change with Lilo's custody. Its just so out of tune with the rest of the themes in the movie and feels more like federal propaganda than a good plot. I get that in real life family doesnt always work out and that child services need to intervene, but realism doesn't always equate to a better story.

- The spoiler is the whole reason I will not be seeing the movie......that is the complete opposite of what the original was about.....OHANA MEANS FAMILY AND FAMILY MEANS NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND OR FORGOTTEN!

- >A social worker made visits to see if Nani could take care of Lilo, and she couldn‚Äôt. So‚Ä¶ Nani went to college, and Lilo was goven to her Aunt. Thats it. 

If you don‚Äôt understand how that undermines the heart of the story, you probably shouldn‚Äôt be making posts like this

- So why spend money to see it vs just watching the original?

    - I couldn't agree more.

    - There isn't a reason. Lol

- Ok, but the original was perfect in every way. Why would you need to recreate it and make everything look almost the same. It makes no f-ing sense.

- Nani letting her sister go completely breaks part of the original films theme. Absolute trash

- Thanks for spoiling the ending. I'll stick to the original.

- >!Disney decided to go with the bad ending for this one. Too much was changed for no reason it seems!<

- I think it‚Äôs was a ok kids movie but the ruined some of the characters and it was an unnecessary visually unappealing adaptation of a great film.

- Just wait till you see the original.

- Loved it !

- My daughter is absolutely obsessed with stitch. All stitch everything. I can‚Äôt wait to take her to see it.  It looks soo cute and I kno she will love it.

- I'm glad people are enjoying the movie and it sounds about like I expected.  
  
Personally, I have absolutely no animosity for this movie or the cast and crew.   
  
It's just that, like all of the Disney remakes, I don't much see the point and wish the energy and talent was spent telling a new story.

- YOU WON'T GET ME DISNEY CORPORATE PLANT

- Would you not have rather experienced an entirely new story than one rehashed into a medium it wasn't made for?

I don't understand this obsession with remakes when there's an infinite number of stories to tell. This new genre of live action remakes is just profiteering off nostalgia.

- I just see no point in this movie existing, the movie Lilo and Stitch already exists and its beautiful and easily accesible

- I don‚Äôt really remember this movie, I‚Äôll have to rewatch the original again but, why did they take out the captain guy and it being the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù

    - The director said they took him out to make the story more emotional but I‚Äôm fairly sure they took him out as it was originally a Disney plus film so to save on CGI.

        - Yeah it was 100% a CGI decision

    - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember the original movie, but removing an original character was the right decision‚Äù

 ü§î

- You may have enjoyed it for what it was. But that does not make it a faithful adaptation of the original movie. 

I just don‚Äôt get it with these live actions. How hard is it to copy a movie that‚Äôs already made. You don‚Äôt even have to write a script. It‚Äôs already done. You just have to find actors and do some CGI.

- >!"A social worker made visits to see if Nani could take care of Lilo, and she couldn't. So... Nani went to college, and Lilo was given to her Aunti. Thats it."!<

And that's enough, a needless and terrible change to the movie.

- I think your review fails to look at the movie in the context of the culture and setting of the plot. It‚Äôs giving just turn your brain off and it‚Äôs not that bad

- You think the council woman is hot.  Your judgement can't be trustee

- Not planning to see the movie anytime soon so I went and read the spoiler... I hate it, even if you frame it like that...

- Honestly I think >!Nani going to college was valid.!<

>!Yes, Nani is no longer Lilo's guardian, but it's temporary. It's fostering, not adoption, she's living with people she already knows well and who care a lot about her, and Nani is still able to visit whenever she wants. She isn't capable of raising Lilo and giving her a stable environment at that moment in time, and now she has a chance to spend a few years growing as a person, studying for a lucrative career that puts her skills and knowledge to use, and then when she's done she'll likely be able to offer Lilo a far more stable home while also working in her dream job and having the money to support her.!<

>!Yest, the system can be a problem at times, but in this case it really was the best option for everyone involved IMO, it wasn't done out of malice on anyone's part, and Nani is still very involved in Lilo's life despite the fact that they're not living together for a while. It reminds me a lot of Mrs. Doubtfire, where Sally Field and Robin Williams insisted the parents stay divorced because they didn't want to give kids going through that false hope, and they wanted to show that a divorced family could still be loving and respectful. !<

    - >!Marine biology is not a lucrative field though, the median is $45k, the job market is very limited, highly competitive and getting any decent job requires more than just a bachelor‚Äôs- it needs both a lot of job experience and often graduate degrees. By the time Nani gets to making decent money that can support a household in Hawaii, a very expensive state, it‚Äôll probably be time to for Lilo to go to college herself.!<

>!Also, I‚Äôm sorry, but you can‚Äôt be very involved in someone‚Äôs life when you live a 6 hour plane ride away. Even if they did go the auntie/college route, having Nani go to the mainland is just bizarre when there‚Äôs excellent schools in Hawaii. Yeah, I know she got a scholarship to go to SF but why not have her get a scholarship to UH Manoa? My older sister lives in Europe, a 6 hour plane ride away. I love her and she loves me, but no, we are not very involved and active in each other‚Äôs daily lives. Not particularly feasible thing to do with big distances and time zone differences.!<

>!Edit: y‚Äôall can yowl about that dumbass portal gun, and honestly? Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a stupid deus ex machina, because the fact of the matter is Nani AGREED TO SURRENDER Lilo to foster care halfway through the movie! Before any of the convoluted fix it with the neighbor stepping in, getting the gun, etc. she still made the decision to give up her sister to foster care and go to college in the mainland. So honestly just bc they came up with a bandaid doesn‚Äôt mean shit bc Nani would have given up her sister to CPS and moved off island with or without the gun. Not to mention that little speech of ‚Äúohana sounds nice but it‚Äôs fake bc we were left behind and this is the REAL WORLD‚Äù is a complete and utter betrayal of the OG movie‚Äôs message and Nani‚Äôs character. Argue with the wall!<

        - Wait she surrendered her halfway through the movie? Holy crap

        - 6 hr plane ride...someone hasn't watched the movie.

            - I forgot that stupid portal gun. I just wanted to leave at that point. Still a weird decision for the movie to make imo.

    - Finally a comment actually agreeing with that.

I don't know why everyone is acting like Nani completely abandoned Lilo to an orphanage or something. It's a happy ending and the theme of ohana is still fully here.

- I didn't even know they released this.  It might be a good movie, I've never commented.  But I wish they would stop making everything live-action CGI now....honestly what is the problem with just keeping things as cartoons?  Do people genuinely not want those anymore or is this something that Pixar and Disney are telling people that they want just so that they can recycle old movies?

-  My single complaint is using the term "Live action" when it looks like over 90% CGI. Disney does this with all their remakes.

- The change with Nani I still don‚Äôt like but also understand. But that‚Äôs my issue with live action movies. You have to make them more real whereas with animation so many more things can get a pass and don‚Äôt have to be explained. 

The original movie had one of the best ending sequences in Disney history. It‚Äôs a shame they messed with that.

- Just seems like a worse version of the original. 

It might be enjoyable but it'll be cheaper and more enjoyable to just watch the original.

- They took out Captain Gantu, one of the most memorable characters in the original movie (imo)? Pass.

- My kids and wife loved that movie

- Did everyone else catch the Angel ref on the ship near the end before 617?

- Just watched it with my 5 y/o girl. Was a great movie all around.

- I thought it was wonderful

- Honestly, I've only seen people trash it on Reddit before it even came out lmao

- Whoa. Disney decided to use persons of color to represent the people depicted in the animation? Disney acting a lil sus ü§î

- Saw it yesterday and really enjoyed it. ¬†Perfect casting. ¬†Cried a bit. ¬†Laughed a bit. Enjoyed the cinematography and the writing. ¬†It had a good pace. Not upset with the new ending. ¬†

- Agree 100%. Most of the concerns were waaaay overblown. Pleakley even wears women‚Äôs clothing items throughout the movie.

- Well said. Literally just watched with my two daughters a couple hours ago and the oldest (9) teared up and loved the movie. 
My takeaways were that the dialogue was very limited and I think the actresses were just not very good so they couldn‚Äôt do much with them. They were just fine but it played like more of a kids action movie to me almost. It was really a nice movie though

- It was great. Different but I think more realistic in some ways

- Took my 7 year old daughter to see it Friday night, we had a blast and I actually thought it was a great movie myself

- I thought it was a great kids movie, seemed very faithful to the original, almost a 1:1 remake.  Lots of fun and just all around enjoyable.  I didn't see the reviews and just went in pretty much blind.

- Just saw it with my kids today - it was great! My girls loved every minute and as a parent it was enjoyable. Sign me up for part 2!

- I freaking loved it, personally.

- Me and my daughter both loved it

- I saw it today with my 6 year old and he loved it! He cried when he thought Stitch was going to be taken away. So that makes it awesome in my eyes. And honestly the way they handled the ending I thought was very well. Families come in all shapes and sizes

- It doesn‚Äôt have enough Elvis

- I enjoyed the movie so much!! It was done extremely well. Stitch & Lilo were just perfect. I want to see it again.

- I just left the theater. It was a really good movie. The acting was great..and stitch was just as hilarious and real looking!

- Went and saw this today myself. I'm a huge Stitch fan, and have been for years. I was worried that they might ruin it much the way they have done to some other ips. But wow, this is one of the best live-action remakes. The actors & actresses were on point the whole film in my opinion. I loved how they pulled in some of the voice actors & actresses from the original movie too. I do hate that we didn't get Captain Ganto, but I don't think it ruins anything for the film. This was very well done!!! I'll probably go watch it again before it leaves theatres.

- Nani is so hot üòã

- Yep I agree. There were a few little nitpicks I had as someone who loved the movie growing up but I sincerely enjoyed the fuck out of the movie. 



Loved stitch, loved lilo, actually grew to like pleakly and his goofy mannerisms. 


I missed gantu being there and jumbas accent but besides that it was solid, probably the best live action Disney movie that my wife and I watched. Being honest, I haven‚Äôt liked any of the live action films until this one and I‚Äôm a little biased as a Hawaiian hahaha.

- The original is much more cartoony and more comedic. This one is much more down to earth in the ways it can be.

I honestly liked it more than the original in the sense of if the original is a 9/10, this is a 9.1/10

- 100% facts. I loved it. My kids loved it. And now we have 2 Lilo and Stitch movies to love. Original and new live action.

- Went to see it yesterday with my 13-year-old granddaughter who loves the original. I really enjoyed it! Lilo is absolutely adorable.

- I saw it yesterday and my whole family loved it. It was a total blast and hit all the right comedy and emotional notes.

- Not related, I ate at Buffalo Wild Wings and it was ok. 

Had to poop after but that‚Äôs chill.

- The neighbors role, really helped make the movie, real-life. It added comedy, and helped connect the crowd to ‚ÄúOhana‚Äù. It helped make the family extensions, that we all interact with our individual tribes. 
It helped give a feeling, ‚Äúwhere there‚Äôs love, the tribe will grow‚Äù vibe. Which was pleasant to watch. 

A range of great acting from the whole cast. Even agent bubbles wasn‚Äôt half-bad. I thought the film was really good, considering the risk in creativity involved. It actually gives me more hope for more live-action films.

- Saw it today myself and my son loved it.

- The best of the live action remakes for sure.

- Hadn't read a single review, saw it today with my kids and liked it more than the original. Which is saying something because I really liked the original. This one was funnier and portrayed the emotions of the situations much better. Glad I somehow skipped the reviews before I saw it.

- Thanks for calling all the hate out.  Think it is just people wanting to hate.  A LOT of people who were involved in the original Lilo & Stitch cartoon are involved in making this, and not just the actors.  That can't be said for most of the Live Action remakes, its what made this a safe bet they wouldn't ruin it, but they did have to update and make it different because Live action isn't as fast pace and plot hole loose like animation can be because it is directed towards kids.

Personally loved the movie and think there are a few ways doing what they did open up to do what the cartoon did but not cram it all in to one movie.

- I think stitch, Lilo, nani, pleakly were spot on. Everything else was a no esp jumba! And no mention of the king!

- I lover this movie. Hated snow white love this live. I really felt the emotion in this one. My 8 year old cried and 17 year old told me he felt so emotional.  Definitely a thumbs up

- I loved it. I don‚Äôt like Galafinakis as Jumba and I know why pleakly couldn‚Äôt be his flamboyant, drag wearing self, but they still incorporated it in the outfits he wore and his bubbly personality. Tutu was a nice addition though. I feel like she existing gives David more background. I like that they didn‚Äôt force a romance between Nani and David and let it develop similarly to the original. Gantu not being there sucked though. Gos antics were fun in the original and the spaceship chase scene was my favorite part of the original. With Jumba being sent to space I hope he makes his return in a sequel along with possibly Angel??? Maybe some other experiments in their pods. I loved this one though. This one is probably the second most faithful LA remake (most being Cinderella)

- I don't know why but the live action was way more sad than the original. Maybe because they are played by real human? The original animated one didn't feel this depressing and I never felt their lives were struggling until now.

- Finally, an honest review, without hate or copy paste. I enjoyed the movie.  and I am a long time Lilo & Stitch fan. The scene about Nani is okay, even if I get downwoted :
The film touched many modern aspects. Just like using smartphones, battery operated cars and etc. being different from the animation. In addition there is a portal gun as well. My outcome is they also tried to involve social norms. During the movie we see Nani was top of the class and always had interest in marine biology, however, due to circumstances she was not able to proceed with her career. 
The social worker visits her ( she is the OG voice actress of the Nani from the animation) and literally sees that she can't take care of Lilo. The house is dirty, Lily most of the time alone, unpaid bills and etc. I am not saying Nani is doing it on purpose. She is alone and it's hard for her, it's understandable.
And at the end of the movie, due the outcome and circumstances, Lilo must be taken away, which is acceptable in real life situations imo. However, due to the social worker seeing how everything went through, she and the Aunty came up with a plan to give Lilo the Aunty. Also Lilo, herself, asks Nani to pursue her education and career. Then there is a portal gun with Nani, that shee uses to visit Lilo and sleep with her.
What I am trying to say is, they tried to be realistic. You should not sacrifice your life. If she wants Lilo to have a quality life, in the first place Nani must make herself a quality life, with education and a job. And Lilo is staying with the Auntie.

- I‚Äôm admittedly not a fan of the franchise to begin with and only went to appease my wife but I did like the original cartoon when gave me unnecessarily high expectations for the movie but that‚Äôs the part we tend to forget as adults we want a lot from things that gave us enough the first go around and are intended to entice and entertain the new generation of viewers‚Ä¶.I agree with the OP that it‚Äôs a great kids/family movie and worth seeing but be open to the idea they can‚Äôt replicate everything from the animated version and things have to be changed to fit budgeting and run time deadlines

- I watched this movie yesterday, and I just watched the original today. I think Stitch is too loveable immediately in the new one. Lilo is legitimately mad at him, and understandably so. I also loved Jumba way more in the original, he seems way more clueless in the new one. I also didn't love how many lines were exactly the same. They often felt weird and out of place.

- This is how I'm finding out about a new Lilo and Stitch movie...

- I saw it today with 6 members of my family. 9-69 years old, and we all loved it including my husband.

- I really enjoyed this movie. It was so similar to the cartoon version and they did a fantastic job with it

- I took my kids to see it today based on this post. It was fun. We all enjoyed it.

- I like how Nani is even hotter in this live action version.

- I assumed based on the other brown women lead claims about movies like Wish, the Marvels, and many others being horrible but no they're fine this film wasn't bad. I have some kids in my life who want to see it so badly.

- I really enjoyed the movie. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs higher on my list than most of the ‚Äúlive-action‚Äù remakes.

- I think Pleakley wears a yellow and black plaid skirt in one tmof the scenes, but he is in his human disguise.

- Pleakly wasn't in deag because instead of being undercover as a husband and wife like in the original he and Jumba were clearly undercover as a gay couple.

- It is a great movie yall are way overthinking it.

- My wife and 2 of my kids went (my 4 year old can‚Äôt sit still for 2 hours- took her to an indoor playground) and they loved the movie!

- Listen as a 90sk kid they did this right. Sorry not sorry. They had to modernize it a lil but some scenes were worse for word and action for action of the original. Yeah the plot had some changes but that's what makes it a good movie. We all like cover songs and can appreciate when the creators put a little twist on it. The Disney folks did that here. Gave it a makeover but didn't dim the lights of the OG one

- This makes me so relieved. I love lilo and stitch, it's not one of my all time favorites but I did have the usual Stitch obsession phase. Crazy upset about Pleakley but ahh well, I'll give it a try

- The movie was great. It was a great live action remake and they stayed true to some little things that were nice. Gave consistency a bit. Some things were, of course, different. Such a nostalgic movie will call for heavy criticism. I think it was fantastic, though.

- I absolutely agree. I wrote almost the same exact thing on my Facebook.

- We did kinda get pleakley in drag though, hey wore blouses

- definitely will watch that movie soon

- I saw this in a theatre in Maui yesterday.  When lilo and Nani sing Aloha 'Oe together, the kids in the theatre sang along.  Won't ever forget that.

- I was sobbing my heart out and when I looked over to my left, I saw my boyfriend crying for the first time ! And we're together for 3 years!

- People will complain about anything lol. This is a great ending for the movie, how do people not see that? Lilo is staying with a close neighbor that is practically family, Nani gets to study instead of putting her dreams aside, AND has a portal gun so she can visit her sister every week or anytime she wants. Nani gets her cake and eats it too. It's basically a fairytale ending. Down the road the decision is the best for everyone involved since Nani will have a career to support herself and her sister, and with the portal gun they basically middle finger the system. The sisters are not truly separated.¬†

- I ordered tickets a few weeks out before seeing all the hate online, happy to see my kids should enjoy this anyways and even I might.

- Exactly, im subscribed to both LS Mark and DazzReviews, and both of their Lilo and Stitch 2025 reviews dropped on Thursday just before the movie dropped and i didnt watch those videos as i was planning on seeing it today (sunday as im posting this) with my GF and both the title and thumbnail paint it to be like every other Disney live action, trash. I also had 2 other reviews from other youtubers and both paint the same picture but i refused to watch them to avoid spoilers. I saw the movie with her and for the life of me i cant understand why i saw 4 videos painting it as "another soulless live action remake" when it was very good and we both enjoyed it alot. Its faithful to the OG while being different enough to stand on its own, the CG used for characters like Stitch, the councilwoman, Jumba, etc all look good and not uncanny, and ill admit i was laughing at the human disguise thing being used as a plot device to stop Jumba from the infinite portal loop and allowing Lilo and Stitch to escape the ship as it descending toward the ocean. I personally feel like the reviewers (both youtuber and official movie critics) are looking for a 1 to 1 recreation of the OG 2002 movie but in live action, but i personally loved this movie, its a good live action Disney movie for once [idk fully about some of the others except Little Mermaid sucked and i was annoyed at Pinocchio at parts, the rest i cant speak for, also Disney when you gonna make Atlantis and Treasure Planet live action]

- You clearly don't understand...I'll break it down

A remake with changes = Pisses off Reddit

A straight shot-for-shot remake (HTTYD) = Pisses off Reddit.

Basically just ignore Reddit when it comes to this kind of stuff.

- As an adult who brought my own children to see it, here is my review... 

The movie was actually fanfuckingtastic. My kids loved it, I loved it and my wife loved it. The haters can suck an egg.

- I felt the same way about A Minecraft Movie, people are taking these movies super seriously.¬†

- I agree with you totally! It was a pretty good rendition of the original. Kinda in the same way they did the Sonic movies. It didn‚Äôt feel like you were watching a cartoon and I‚Äôm sure budget probably played a part in not having Capt Gantu but like you said, it worked fine and made sense. I would‚Äôve loved it if Ving Rhames could‚Äôve played Bubbles but Courtney Vance played him well and sounded very similar to him. Solid kids movie

- Thank you for a true review, so many ridiculous takes from people that have clearly not seen it and just want to jump on the train of everything Disney equal bad. 
Can't wait for it to come to Disney+ to re-watch and one day a sequel, hopefully while Lilo' actress is young enough to reprise.

- I saw it yesterday. Whole family enjoyed it. That‚Äôs what mattered to me.

- This movie was awesome! My daughter and I loved it. If anyone is talking shit they're nuts.

- This is actually the only live action Disney remake I‚Äôve been happy with so far

- It's a great kids movie, and my toddler loved it. Good everything, Disney has a hit on their hands

- We took the kids to watch it this weekend and it was a good movie. While the end was a bit dragged out, my kids enjoyed it and my daughter loved it, and at the end of the day, seeing her enjoy it is all that matters.

- I saw it today and it was great. I‚Äôm glad they kept some of the dialogue at the end, and the new characters made me laugh and feel more connected to the already existing ones.

- Prob the Critical Stinker and his ilk spewing their collective bile on anything remotely related to Disney.

- Truly understand not everyone will like the same thing but it‚Äôs really upending to see how many people are personally attacking Dean, Chris the new writer and the actors? Why attack them and not focus direction and frustrations. Like take a look at their social media pages? Users are calling for their heads and sexual violence? What is wrong with us? It‚Äôs a movie

- Couldn‚Äôt agree more with your thoughts. Maybe I‚Äôm getting soft as I get older and maybe my five year olds enjoyment of it amplified my own but I almost loved it. It‚Äôs a genuinely sweet, heartfelt movie and the acting by Lilo and the sister was very good!

- Took my kids to see it on opening night and we had a ball. I don't know what the naysayers were expecting: "The Godfather"? It was fun. You walk out of the theater with a smile. If you leave thinking "I had a good time" the filmmakers did their jobs.

- The little girl was ADORABLE and she did a really good job, I just dont feel Lilo was dramatic enough¬†

- Agreed. My family and I went to see it today, and the only thing I had a hard time ‚Äògetting over‚Äô was Zach G‚Äôs voice not fitting the character. Billy Magnussen was, per his usual, wonderful. Stitch was just as crazy/chaotic/loveable as before, which my son loved. And my wife, who is the daughter of immigrants, really appreciated that Nani didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice her life to take care of Lilo, that there is community to help get through those times and come out better in the end. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs as good as the first one, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt a disappointment or disaster like the discourse says.

- I saw it this evening with my wife and kid (who‚Äôs a huge Lilo and Stitch fan). 

We all really enjoyed it! Afterwards I was on IMBD and the r/movies discussion and wasn‚Äôt pretty surprised people were dogging it. I liked the changes they decided to make. The part where the aliens turned human and were trying to figure out how to walk and check into a hotel was hilarious.

- You do realize that people just hate Disney because they broke

- Took my daughter Friday. Honestly, all I wanted was something to kill some time on a day where I had her myself due to her school burning off some unused snow days and my wife being on a trip, so it did it's job. The one thought I kept having was how I couldn't believe how good a job the girl playing the sister was doing. I read beforehand that the initial plan was to go straight to streaming, but she really went all out. I wonder if this will springboard her to some real projects given the massive success, would be nice to see, gotta love a genuine up-and-comer story.

- I havent watch it yet but I got spoiled through the internet. 

And like about that ending >!Nani got a teleportation gun apparently and so she was able to come home every night. So like what‚Äôs the problem there? It‚Äôs the same as coming home from work or school. Plus she is saving money so she won‚Äôt have to rent out near uni.!<

- I don‚Äôt ever get my opinions from the internet anymore. I go watch what I enjoy and that‚Äôs it. 
This one is def on my list next

- I think it's a great movie. As a society, we needed some feel good things and this definitely is a feel good movie. As my dad would say...if the critics hate it then it's a good movie. I loved it!

- Yeah I love it.

- Absolutely agree. While I was watching the live action movie I didn‚Äôt even realized that Gantu was missing. And I have seen the original one the last time in December.

- Probably best of all those lazy "live action CGI remakes" from Disney in recent years.

- I enjoyed the movie with a few exceptions, but overall I would give 8/10

- Your spoiler contradicts itself. The two situations you mention are the same situation.

- Just got back from it. 

My 2 cents 

My kid loved it. I cried, my wife cried. It was a very touching and real. I think it flowed much better then some other live action movies and overall stuck to the original. 

It was a good example of "modernization" of a movie without making it a joke for 90 mins. Would recommend it.

- Nani in the original film sings her little sister Aloha ‚ÄòOe which was composed by the last queen of Hawaii, Queen Lili‚Äôuokalani. 

Which basically translates to ‚Äúfarewell to thee‚Äù

She composed this in response to the United States government annexing her state without any say from her people

Nani dead ass sings this to her little sister the night that Bubbles says he‚Äôs gonna take Lilo. That‚Äôs how she says goodbye. Because she doesn‚Äôt have a goddamn choice 

It‚Äôs not just a song. It is a remorseful and unwilling farewell. She has nothing more she can do. She‚Äôs backed into a corner. So she sings to her little sister, a song of remorse and fear and sadness.

And you want it to be that she‚Ä¶willingly walked away? To go the mainland with the very people who made it impossible for them to live? 

Knowing full well that the negative impacts of tourism is something that Lilo canonically documents in the original film?

I‚Äôm so tired of people taking movies that meant something, that were made with such care and consideration and turning them into bullshit cash grabs

Re release the original film, touch it up, put in deleted scenes

Don‚Äôt strip a movie of its heart and tell me it‚Äôs more or less the same. The more was the point.

- I haven‚Äôt see the movie so I can‚Äôt say for certain everything was handled well. But I felt like this website was really being unfair to Nani. She‚Äôs 19 years old, just out of high school, has also just lost her parents in a tragic accident, and she‚Äôs expected to drop everything and become essentially a single mom? It‚Äôs not like her alternative is abandon Lilo in an alley. It sounds like Lilo is being cared for by someone who is close to the family and will take good care of her while Nani is still able to go and live her life, including getting an education that would open her to better job opportunities so she doesn‚Äôt have to spend 10 years frantically working to support her and her sister. 

If Nani posted on AITA I strongly believe people would be ok with her doing this and probably throw around words like parentification but somehow in the movie it‚Äôs bad.

- Ah yes, supporting a lack of responsibility and reliability by creating a completely separate character to take over when Nani fails. Where the fuck was this "Auntie" the entire fucking time Nani was raising Lilo?

The reviews aren't disingenuous, the idea that a young woman ended up taking over for their parents after they died in an accident, the reason behind Lilo's coping mechanism, the explanation she gives to Stitch regarding why she hates rainy days, all of it was erased for this 1hr 48 minute and badly written rehash on a movie that resonated with so many people.

Gantu gave us a "villain" to root against when the heroes (Jumba, Pleakly, and Stitch) tried to rescue Lilo from him.  Jumba's entire personality and the "fun" mad scientist aspect was erased. Pleakly lost his sense of self and is BORING. 

Cobra Bubbles isn't as intimidating as he was in the original, and the entire attempt at a remake lacks ANY kind of vision or the endearing personality and emphasis on human empathy that you can feel when Nani realizes her sister is gone. 

This movie doesn't even play out the entire point the original made. Ohana Means Family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.

BUT LET'S THROW ALL THAT OUT SO NANI CAN SHOW A MORE SELFISH SIDE AND ABANDON HER BABY SISTER TO SOMEONE THAT NEVER EXISTED IN THE ORIGINAL FILM AND BECAME THE DEUS EX MACHINA METHOD OF CREATING A LAZY ENDING.

This movie should never have been made. It does no justice to the original and like every other CGI remake Disney has been doing since Aladdin, they are just trying to re-cash in on their previous IP's to make back the money that Chapek lost and was replaced over.

- The whole movie was propaganda. 

They removed Gantu so cops wouldn't look bad, made the scientist the villain, removed the drag, and had the native girl give up her family to the state so she could leave hawaii for a degree natives can get for FREE.

- I felt somewhat similarly about The Little Mermaid. Though the new songs were completely forgettable, Halle Bailey was genuinely excellent, and her chemistry with the male lead was cheek-pinchingly cute. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit, and I don't even have kids. (Ariel was my wife's favorite Disney princess growing up so we had to see it lol.) Just goes to show, imo, that the DEI uproar from these terminally online losers is just a bunch of manufactured nonsense. Disney has hits and misses because of behind-the-camera decisions that lead to low-effort writing and directing, while the skin color and political stances of its stars have literally nothing to do with it.

- It was good, but they left out some key and iconic parts from the original. 

First, agent bubbles was revealed to be an agent from the offset, the reveal in the OG is part of the satisfying ending so that felt like an odd choice. More on bubbles; his intro to Lilo &co felt rushed. 

The whole dialogue in that scene was super rushed- her noticing cobra on his knuckles, his cool calm and hard persona which added to the comic relief was not there at all... 

in all honesty a LOT of the scenes rushed through dialogue in place of more action sequences  which... funnily enough... ALSO felt rushed and forced. 

The 'I'm lost/ugly duckling scenes' never happen 

Lilo being annoyed at stitch after he ruined Nani's chances of getting a job, then Stitch grabbing the surfboard and giving LILO a bashful head nudge scene never happened 

Lilo being bullied by her 'friends' after the dance never happed 

Jumba and Bleakley... gosh. Don't even get me started on how much they were negged. So many missed funny moments and scenes. And Jumba just got completely relegated to one dimensional villain with no personality or quirk. 

Idk. Some parts were gorgeous and pretty much frame for frame just like the film: which made it even more jarring that some meaningless scenes were super true to the source material and then they changed or just left out super important scenes. 

Ah well. It was a 6.5/10 for me, but the cartoon remains a solid 10/10.

- Yea...this reads like someone that wanted to take a positive spin on the movie regardless of what it actually was.

Gantu was the big bad. You quite literally cannot take him out and call it the same movie...which they did...and so deserves to be critiqued regardless of how well you personally think they changed the story.

The ending with Lilo and Nani being split up is just as ridiculous to change as Nani WAS able to take care of Lilo and help from not just herself but her community to embody what a family means in Hawaiian culture and how they leave nobody behind (or with an aunt so they can fuck off and go study because its too hard in this version of the story...)

- Lilo and Nani didn‚Äôt have any other family so they made up a fake aunt

- Did dude just simp for an alien?

    - Yes, and I'll do it again

- Stop making these live action adaptations if they‚Äôre going to not make a faithful adaptation. NONE of these live action remakes have been good or done ‚Äúvery well‚Äù at the box office. They have all made some alterations and that takes out what made these films so memorable in the first place. These are all nothing but cash grabs that turn in to cash wastes.

- This is the first time I‚Äôve seen a post from this sub on my feed and it convinced me that this is not a real critic sub. Muting it now.

- Literally JUST finished it and I gotta say‚Ä¶ not a fan. It felt rushed and completely lacking. If I had come into the theater never having seen the original I wouldn‚Äôt have  picked up on the ‚Äòsisterly bond‚Äô and the friendship/character arc of Stitch. They also TRASHED Jumba and Pleakly. Another money grab live action IMO.

- It‚Äôs not MY Lilo & Stitch, that‚Äôs for sure. I really wish the entirety of Hollywood would stop pushing out remakes and sequels that are just wholly unnecessary. Changing the ending undermines the plot and message of the original film.

    - Did you see the live action movie?

- I‚Äôll wait until the live action Emperors New Groove gets released.

    - pleaaaase dont manifest that. that movie is perfect and a live action cannot execute the same humor and charisma even a little bit

- We watched it on opening night and we all really enjoyed it

- This thing reminds me of the cricket that screams nonstop on The Simpsons.

- I thought the little CGI aliens looked pretty good too for a change so I was hoping the movie would be good. Thanks for the review!

- Are the UGF raptor like troopers in the live action? Used to love those guys as a kid.

- I liked it the firs time when it was called Lilo and Stitch.

- The movie had a lot of charm and some genuinely great moments - I‚Äôve definitely seen much worse. However, let‚Äôs be real- there were some big misses. The biggest possibly is Zach Galifianakis. Terribly miscast for Jumba and his performance is just bad. His voice over work doesn‚Äôt match his live action work- it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs portraying two completely different characters.

- 100% this.

- I feel like I speak for all of us when I say that we prefer the cartoon Nani though, which is bunk..

- I genuinely enjoyed the movie. People expecting it to be a frame by frame remake will be disappointed, but come on with an open mind expecting a new movie and you‚Äôll enjoy it. What a genuinely good movie

- Nani tried to let Stitch drown twice lol

- Zach Galifianakis did not do a good job lol. I thought he was pretty lame

- Regardless they ruined the original and need to stop retelling and changing stories that have already been loved just for the sake of making it live action. Tainting another masterpiece with live action slop is becoming Disney‚Äôs go to move.

- Let the record show that Pleakley never did ‚Äúdrag‚Äù due was undercover and wearing a disguise. Drag is such a specific thing and isn‚Äôt simply throwing a dress and wig on a man

- Didn't I see somewhere about Disney stopping real life adaptations?

- I agree with every word of your statement. Especially about jungle book. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.

- As someone who has not seen this movie and was actively crapping on it earlier You are right, we should see a movie before trying to discuss it. I‚Äôm not going to see this and that‚Äôs fine. No need to add to the fire. Thank you

- I had low expectations because, well you know, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and could keep on going. But, I really enjoyed this movie. I got choked up a few times and would absolutely recommend watching it.

- I saw the movie too. It‚Äôs an ok kids movie for people who haven‚Äôt seen the animated movie.

But my god, what a way to ride the movie so hard. It wasn‚Äôt a good movie in general

>!But I agree, the council woman is kinda a baddie!<

- My seven yr old daughter saw it yday and cried 2x she loved the movie!!!

- If I would be a kid I would want to watch an actual drawn cartoon instead of a CGI shitfest live action movie...

- Nani was very miscast imo. Pleakly was well casted, Zach not so much I think. Bubbles was miscast imo as well. That‚Äôs most of my problems with the movie. Stitch was perfect, and was probably who made me laugh the most. I do feel the pacing was a bit off as well too. Being such a big fan of the original it‚Äôs hard not to compare, so I tried my best to go in thinking this was a stand alone.

- slop content

- Yes! My sister and I went to go see this, it was one of our top favorite movies as kids. And I really loved it. They handled it really well. I was disappointed that Gantu wasn't in it, and I feel they did take away from Jumbas character simply by removing Gantu which caused Jumba to be the main bad guy. Which he kind of was in the original, but I feel in the original he had more humor to his evilness. And that he also had a soft spot that this movie didn't portray. But on the other hand, I think they really captured a deeper level of Nanis struggle with losing their parents and taking over care of Lilo. Which was heart warming and melancholy. The change in Nanis story line wasnt huge but I think it really did her and Lilos characters justice, and gave us adult fans a deeper connection with the adult problems that existed in the original movie as well. 
I was prepared to be disappointed with the CGI and especially with Plekli, but the actor really portrayed him well and it was easy to adjust to the human disguise. 
10/10 live action remake on Disney's part. This is easily my favorite love action they've done. They kept so much of the original as well that a lot of the movie really felt like watching the original for the first time again. 
Also whoever worked on that CGI was fantastic! Idk how they pulled it off without it feeling out of place or weird, but they did. It felt as natural as a fully CGI alien possibly could. 
(Side mention for David's actor, he rocked it perfectly and script wise they handled it exactly how they should've)

- I completely agree with this. We saw it with the family yesterday afternoon‚Äîour kiddo has been a huge Stitch fan for years.

Honestly, I went in with low expectations, especially knowing it was originally planned as a Disney+ release. But I was pleasantly surprised. It‚Äôs a solid kids‚Äô movie. Yes, there are differences from the animated original, but the changes and expansions worked fine for us.

Surprisingly, even my wife‚Äîwho rarely cries at movies‚Äîgot emotional during a few scenes.

As for the online negativity, I‚Äôve seen some of the comments, and honestly, I have no idea what movie those people watched.

- I just saw this yesterday with my 4 year old. I think a lot of people were expecting a live-action remake of the original and, honestly, I don't think that would've worked. This is a reimagining of the original and, while a few things weren't as good, I understand why the underlying choices were made. We loved it overall, and it helped get my kid super excited for surf camp this summer.

- Was Nani thicc like the classic please tell me Nani was still thicc?

- I hate how everybody on the internet is a super hard on over movies, especially remakes, and then think stuff like Dune is a masterpiece. A couple of questions a movie has to answer but the most important of all is "is the movie enjoyable and well made or not?" and if it is, in its own way, then it's a movie worth making and watching. 

"What's the point of making a live action of a perfect cartoon?" yeah what's the point of doing anything at all? Idk maybe because it's interesting watching a different form of the same thing? maybe kids today now know about the franchise which now has a fresh life being brought into it and it's enteren the collective mind again like super heroes are? if anything I'd prefer this story to be retold. Maybe because a live action is enjoyable in it's own way? maybe if the picture is realistic for a lot of people it might feel more relatable?

- Yeah, I get that the Disney live action movies have been pretty shit on average but this was not it. However the internet does not want to admit when a narrative doesn‚Äôt fit their presupposed ideas and just tries to find any kind of fault. The complaints about the end are clearly from someone who has not seen the ending and the adjustments that were made to make it work surprisingly well.

- I agree with everything you said except:



>Zach Galifianakis did great as well


He did well for who he is, but he is NOT the scientist. Every other character was faithfully adapted. But instead of an overweight, zealous, and evil Russian, we get Zach. It felt wrong in every scene.

- I took my niece (6) and nephew (11) to watch this movie. I was worried that they were bored then I noticed that both were crying from a certain scene. I didn‚Äôt realize until then that they were still and quiet because they were really into the movie. I went in with low expectations myself but was pleasantly surprised how good it was.

- I was surprised how good the trailer look. It actually looked like a potentially good live action. My son and wife just got out of the theater and said it was good. It‚Äôs my son‚Äôs first movie, he loves stitch to say the least.

- Why‚Äôd they cut my boy gantu?

- It‚Äôs one of my 4 year olds favorite cartoons. Saw it in theaters and the subtle changes to the story made I‚Äôd different and changed enough to keep her attention. Loved it. Would recommend it to anyone who is a Lilo and Stitch fan.

- Wasn‚Äôt the whole point of the original to let Nani and Lilo (and Stitch) together as a family?

- Not watching this slop. No Gantu, no thanks.¬†

- My little sister and I ( 8 years apart) grew up watching this movie and always called each other Lilo& Nani. ü•π it was OUR movie, we're planning to watch the live action in a few weekends- can't wait üíõ little sisters fianc√©e is Stitch xD and my husband is totally David. lol I'm looking to most of the soundtrack staying the same too! The fight scene Lilo and Nani had in the animated movie is literally me and my sis lol

- I thought they took out key moments from the original that were the heart and soul of the movie. These were scenes I was so excited to see because of what they communicated to children in the original, and they were cut üò≠. Also, from a set design perspective, yikes. Nothing was added or made better. Everything looked so drab and dark. 
These two points were not cost prohibitive and the movie really did leave me with a feeling that Disney has once again turned in a project without understanding the assignment. This adaptation just really fell flat for me. Definitely should have remained a Disney+ streaming show IMO. 

But yes, love seeing a discussion of movies on this thread haha ü§£

- So many folks talking about the ending and I just wanted The Ugly Duckling

- Agreed 100%

- i though the movie was just so boring!

- Nani: ‚ÄúOhana means no one gets left behind or forgotten‚Äù - proceeds to leave Lilo behind‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶. 


‚ÄúBut she HAD to!‚Äù - uhm no, they could‚Äôve just followed the source material? Smh

- Meh still wont watch it.

- No gantu not seeing

- I thought it was a great movie. They can‚Äôt do everything exactly the same as the cartoon. Some things just wouldn‚Äôt translate. They made stitch amazing. My wife and I were laughing the whole time. It sucked that jumba didn‚Äôt get the redemption arc but I‚Äôm sure he will if they make a second one. I (30m) was crying in the cinemas watching stitch come to peace with drowning at the bottom of the ocean. Great movie over all, sure I would‚Äôve liked more parts of the original in there but it was great how it was for me

- whether or not you enjoy it doesn‚Äôt nullify the fact this movie was most likely made because the people that saw it as kids have children. that‚Äôs fucking it. 

this kind of behavior is a microcosm of capitalism and how disingenuous it is lol.

- The live action Disney films always suck.  This one was ok but nothing memorable.  It give a 5/10

- Sorry but as an older sibling there is simply no "dream" I value more than being there 100% for my little sister, no matter what. Even if it's "just fostering," and "it's their neighbor/friend!" or "she can still visit!" you would have to physically kill me to get me to relinquish custody of my sister to anyone else. We don't leave each other behind. 

The new ending is a slap in the face of the original. (Well, all of it was imo, but especially that bullshit ending.) Nani would never put Lilo on the backburner. What a soulless husk of a movie.

(Also, there's a university in Hawaii...that SPECIALIZES in marine science. What was the point of making her go to California for it?)

- Amazing movie and I loved it.

- The best review I have heard is something along the lines of remaking a really good movie, but not as good as the original, is still pretty good.¬†

It‚Äôs like when David Lee Roth left Van Halen. People still went and saw Van Halen and enjoyed the show.¬†

- ‚ÄúA complete lie‚Äù okay, so what, Nani *doesn‚Äôt* give up lilo willingly? They *don‚Äôt* turn uncle Jamba into the bad guy?

- In my opinion the problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a bad movie on its own but more so that if it‚Äôs going to be like 80% shot for shot recreation of the original why would you want to see this. It hits the main plot point scenes but without any of the context for them happening. Like the most blatant example is the change in heart of stitch happening after the ugly duckling story parallel which just doesn‚Äôt happen at all in the live action movie.

- Release a kids movie that's a remake from when the parents were kids right when school ends for the year, a recipe for success.

- Not surprised. I went to see it and could only find one showing with decent seats. All of the other showings were packed and only had seats right up against the screen.

    - They're definitely doing something right with this one. I've been to the cinema about 5 times in the last 20 years but ended up in there last week watching this with the kids.

- I took my kids. It was ok. Paint by numbers but movie style. I feel like I‚Äôve seen this movie a million times.

    - Took my 4 year old to see it last weekend as her first movie theatre experience. She was bored during a lot of it as was I. I didn‚Äôt have high hopes but it seemed like the best option.

- Spitting on the original film is lucrative. üòÇ üò≠

- Lazy.

- Ya know. When you do this kind of ‚Äúredo‚Äù and cater to the story above politics, you end up with this. Not the best but it was good and my kids absolutely adored it

- Given the amount of online hate for this movie, I went in with low expectations.  It exceeded them.  I enjoyed it a lot.

- I‚Äôm be heard both positive and negative reviews on the live action.

- Of course it did. 

Think the lesson to learn is we thought those movies in the past having quality was what made them sell.

But nope people really never gave a shit in the first place.

Kinda glad movies are on the way out if this the shit that sells.

    - Perpetually online neckbeard Rick & Moriarty fanboy complaining about everyone but him/mass culture for the millionteenth time. News at 11.

- The girl who plays lilo is literally one of the worst actors ever.  It's a shame given how talented the original voice actress was
['What are your thoughts on Lilo & Stitch live action remake?', '']

- Unnecessary

    - It was unnecessary, but it honestly really wasn‚Äôt bad. Probably Ohana‚Äôs family is like the best part cause they did that shot for shot.

- It shouldn't be made.

    - I‚Äôm still going to watch it‚Ä¶

- ‚Äúpls stop doing this‚Äù is my original thought.

- They changed the ice cream cone into a snow cone. 0/10

- A bit tired of all the Disney "live action" remakes.  Stop fucking around with my childhood favorites with all these CGI ladened "live action" money grabs.

- Stitch is really popular at the moment, so this is for the extra cash grab. Business wise it makes perfect sense for them to make this film.

    - Little blue guys always been popular tbh but if it's done right why is it a problem to people lady an tramp was a Disney plus day one an in my eyes is the best larm that has come from Disney so it can be done just few an far between since Disney started doings series's there consistency has become weak very weak should have left marvel enough alone imho

- I‚Äôll watch it out of curiosity

- Disney keeping its recycling tradition alive and well.

- Not needed. At all.

- Craptacular.

- üé∂dum dum dum dum dumüé∂

- Unless I see a review that says it's surprisingly good, I'm boycotting all of them. The last one I gave a chance was Dumbo, I think. Because of my enduring love of Dumbo. Big mistake, it was so bad.

- I‚Äôm just glad that Stitch looks better than I thought. Probably would have to drag it so bad like we did Sonic until they got it right.

Ving Rhames should have played Cobra Bubbles since he voiced the character and still has the body build.

    - He's probably busy with Mission Impossible

- Fine and I think it looks good but honestly this is the wrong year to release it when my beloved how to train your dragon is getting a live action that looks freaking amazing

- I expect it to be like the Aladdin remake and the Little Mermaid remake. Nothing substantially different from the animated versions (no matter how much some fragile people disagree), but a great excuse to share these stories with my kiddo

- I'm not a big fan of live action remakes. They are just cash grabs. Why can't disney put all of this money into making new and exciting stories?

- Hate a remake but it doesn't look like it'll be as bad as it sounds. The artists did a good job coming up with a CGI stitch that isn't terrifying and the actress they cast for Lilo is a dang cutiepie

- I kinda wanna see it anyway, as unnecessary as it is. It looks fun!

- I am also tired of those milking and trying to ruin childhood masterpieces with remakes. 100% it will be disaster like with Mufasa live-action film. Man, knowing those bastards from Disney, they will not stop and I pray God that at least let Emperor‚Äôs Groove (animated film, who is pretty known for it‚Äôs memes and characters (aka Kuzco, Pacha, Yzma, Kronk and, well, you get the idea)) remain untamed. But who am I kidding? Of course those Disney bastards will do same with Emperor‚Äôs Groove, since they already did that to Mulan, Lion King, Aladdin and now Lila & Stitch.

- My thoughts?? Disney is sick. Dr jumba has a dick for a nose. Plain as day.

- Can we please, for the love of cinema, get new stories instead of remaking the same movies over and over?

    - If they weren‚Äôt profitable, they would.

- As pointless as all the other LARMs. There's basically nothing live action can do that animation can't do better
['Lilo & Stitch (casting)', 'No I haven‚Äôt went and seen the new Lilo and Stitch & more than likely won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just curious would anyone happen to know what Ving Rhames didn‚Äôt play (Cobra Bubbles)?\nü•≤ it‚Äôs also very sad to know Gantu was cut out.']
