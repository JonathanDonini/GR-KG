<p>[female voice]
</p><p>We have apprehended
</p><p>a dangerous threat
</p><p>in one of our very own labs.
</p><p>- [crowd gasping]
</p><p>- Quiet!
</p><p>We believe that this...
</p><p>this monstrosity...
</p><p>- [snoring]
</p><p>- [crowd gasping]
</p><p>...is the product of illegal
</p><p>genetic experimentation.
</p><p>What deranged lunatic would
</p><p>create something like this?
</p><p>[alien grunts, clears throat]
</p><p>I prefer "deranged genius,"
</p><p>but thank you
</p><p>for the introduction.
</p><p>Dr. Jumba Jookiba,
</p><p>you were tasked
</p><p>with safely studying
</p><p>biological threats,
</p><p>not creating them.
</p><p>A threat?
</p><p>- Experiment 626...
</p><p>- [glass clanging]
</p><p>...is our federation's
</p><p>most sophisticated weapon.
</p><p>- [growling]
</p><p>- [crowd gasping]
</p><p>626 is unstoppable.
</p><p>Indestructible.
</p><p>[laughs]
</p><p>And smarter
</p><p>than 100 supercomputers.
</p><p>- [speaking Tantalog]
</p><p>- I don't wanna play anymore!
</p><p>It's an atrocity!
</p><p>- Destroy it!
</p><p>- I can't even look at him.
</p><p>He should be exiled.
</p><p>[leader] Silence!
</p><p>He did not ask to be created.
</p><p>Perhaps, if he is
</p><p>so intelligent,
</p><p>he has the capacity to reason.
</p><p>Experiment 626, show us
</p><p>that there is something
</p><p>inside you
</p><p>that is good.
</p><p>[speaking Tantalog]
</p><p>[clears throat]
</p><p>[speaking Tantalog]
</p><p>[crowd gasping]
</p><p>So naughty.
</p><p>Throwing up. Throwing up.
</p><p>I did not teach him that.
</p><p>You have made
</p><p>our decision easy.
</p><p>He is clearly the flawed
</p><p>product of a deranged mind.
</p><p>Dr. Jookiba,
</p><p>your lab will be destroyed.
</p><p>Okay. Just leave me 626.
</p><p>And 626 exiled.
</p><p>Oh, come on!
</p><p>- Bailiff.
</p><p>- Wait.
</p><p>No, no, no, no!
</p><p>You can't do that.
</p><p>No!
</p><p>[grunts] Huh?
</p><p>- [gasps]
</p><p>- Don't get any ideas.
</p><p>These guns are locked on
</p><p>your genetic signature.
</p><p>They're not gonna shoot anyone
</p><p>but you.
</p><p>[laughs]
</p><p>Hmm. Oh.
</p><p>Knock it off! Federation
</p><p>strictly forbids being gross.
</p><p>Don't make me say it-- Ew!
</p><p>[guns charging up]
</p><p>Uh-oh.
</p><p>- [alarms blaring]
</p><p>- [leader] Where is he?
</p><p>He's loose on Deck C.
</p><p>[officer]
</p><p>Now heading for the hull.
</p><p>What?
</p><p>He's trying
</p><p>to find the police...
</p><p>[laughs, blows raspberry,
</p><p>chuckles]
</p><p>...cruisers.
</p><p>He, uh... He took the red one.
</p><p>Fire at will!
</p><p>[cackles]
</p><p>He's in hyperspace.
</p><p>Where will he exit?
</p><p>In 12 hours,
</p><p>we project he will collide
</p><p>with a planet called "E-arth."
</p><p>That's a planet full of water.
</p><p>Water increases
</p><p>his molecular density.
</p><p>[aliens] Uh...
</p><p>He'll become heavy and drown.
</p><p>Oh!
</p><p>So I think we can all say
</p><p>farewell to 62...
</p><p>You're kidding.
</p><p>- [alarms blaring]
</p><p>- [all sighing]
</p><p>Oh, what a pickle
</p><p>we've got here! [chuckles]
</p><p>If only there was
</p><p>a brilliant genius around
</p><p>to help you catch
</p><p>that monster.
</p><p>You! You're the reason
</p><p>we're in this mess.
</p><p>And I could get you out of it.
</p><p>If you release me
</p><p>and give me back my lab.
</p><p>Nonsense. We'll simply
</p><p>vaporize the planet. Captain.
</p><p>Armed and ready,
</p><p>Councilwoman.
</p><p>Hold it! Hold everything!
</p><p>Excuse me. Sorry.
</p><p>Excuse me. Pardon me.
</p><p>You can't destroy the planet!
</p><p>Aw, man.
</p><p>Uh, who's this?
</p><p>Agent Pleakley.
</p><p>Earth expert at your service.
</p><p>Howdy.
</p><p>"Earth expert"?
</p><p>I'm an expert in that planet's
</p><p>flora, fauna and fashion.
</p><p>Yeah, this outfit
</p><p>screams "expert."
</p><p>Yeah. I'm researching
</p><p>an Earth species
</p><p>that's half-cow and half-boy.
</p><p>- It's quite fascinating--
</p><p>- Yes, marvelous.
</p><p>What's your point?
</p><p>Oh, uh, Earth is
</p><p>a protected wildlife reserve.
</p><p>We've been using it to rebuild
</p><p>the mosquito population.
</p><p>[sighs] Crikey. Very well.
</p><p>Dr. Jookiba, you will travel
</p><p>to Earth, where you will
</p><p>capture the escaped
</p><p>lab experiment known as 626.
</p><p>Agent Pleakley,
</p><p>you will be going with him.
</p><p>You are deputized to ensure
</p><p>he follows Federation rules.
</p><p>What?
</p><p>I don't need a babysitter.
</p><p>This is all very dangerous,
</p><p>and it's likely you'll die.
</p><p>Do you accept?
</p><p>[breathes heavily]
</p><p>With every heart in my body,
</p><p>of course I accept!
</p><p>I'm going to Earth!
</p><p>Hey, everyone!
</p><p>- If I may...
</p><p>- Thank you, thank you.
</p><p>- Can I hug you?
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>- Can I hug--
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>Sorry. Permission to hug
</p><p>the Grand Councilwoman?
</p><p>- That's not going to happen.
</p><p>- Of course. My apologies.
</p><p>I do not need supervision.
</p><p>You have asked...
</p><p>Permission to hug
</p><p>my new partner?
</p><p>Brilliant. Permission granted.
</p><p>So what I'm just trying
</p><p>to say is, I--
</p><p>It would just be better
</p><p>if I went by myself.
</p><p>Do not let the Earthlings
</p><p>discover your mission,
</p><p>or I will be forced
</p><p>to intervene.
</p><p>This is a dream vacay.
</p><p>[gasps]
</p><p>I have so much packing to do!
</p><p>Well, well, well, 626.
</p><p>What hideous, pathetic planet
</p><p>is caught in your crosshairs?
</p><p>[♪ "He Mele No Lilo" playing]
</p><p>[breathing through mask]
</p><p>Let's go snorkeling later.
</p><p>Yeah, that's a great idea.
</p><p>I know, right? So cool.
</p><p>They have the best sandwiches.
</p><p>Are you supposed to be here?
</p><p>I'm in town
</p><p>for the convention.
</p><p>Cool.
</p><p>You're free! Go, go!
</p><p>Live your lives!
</p><p>No, no, no! No! Lilo.
</p><p>Not again.
</p><p>They deserve to be free!
</p><p>Lilo!
</p><p>I'm gonna have to talk
</p><p>to Nani about this.
</p><p>[watch alarm beeping]
</p><p>[screams] Sorry!
</p><p>Sorry, sorry. Sorry.
</p><p>[phone ringing]
</p><p>Hey, Jimmy's Luau.
</p><p>Hey, brother.
</p><p>- Go, go. Hurry.
</p><p>- Sorry.
</p><p>Hey. You're gonna be late.
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>[dancer] Where is she?
</p><p>She's always late.
</p><p>[teacher]
</p><p>Has anyone seen Lilo?
</p><p>Lilo, thank goodness.
</p><p>I thought you were gonna
</p><p>be on time today.
</p><p>I had to get a sandwich
</p><p>for Pudge.
</p><p>Is Pudge a friend in need?
</p><p>He's a fish.
</p><p>I forgot to tell you that.
</p><p>So, you're late because
</p><p>you fed a sandwich to a fish?
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>Pudge controls the weather.
</p><p>[chuckles] She's so weird.
</p><p>Lilo, honey, come on.
</p><p>Get dressed, honey.
</p><p>Oh, guys, look.
</p><p>I got
</p><p>a friendship bracelet too.
</p><p>[dancer] That's not
</p><p>a friendship bracelet.
</p><p>Ew, garbage girl
</p><p>puts garbage on her arm.
</p><p>Girls, hāmau. Hoʻomākaukau.
</p><p>Come on.
</p><p>You know, silly,
</p><p>it's not a friendship bracelet
</p><p>if you don't have any friends.
</p><p>Girls, girls, girls.
</p><p>Hui! Kulikuli.
</p><p>Stand in line. Get ready.
</p><p>[engine sputters]
</p><p>No, no, no.
</p><p>Okay, not today.
</p><p>She's not coming.
</p><p>[audience murmuring]
</p><p>- [dancer screams]
</p><p>- [audience clamoring]
</p><p>- Kumu!
</p><p>- [attendee] Who's her parents?
</p><p>Girls, go.
</p><p>[attendee 1]
</p><p>She acts up all the time.
</p><p>[attendee 2] Somebody
</p><p>needs to look after her.
</p><p>She's always causing trouble.
</p><p>[attendee 1]
</p><p>She's just not a good fit.
</p><p>Kumu, where is her sister?
</p><p>That's the real question here.
</p><p>[teacher] It's a delicate
</p><p>home situation for Lilo.
</p><p>She's not a bad kid.
</p><p>She just needs--
</p><p>[attendee 1]
</p><p>I don't know, Kumu.
</p><p>I just don't know.
</p><p>[attendee 2]
</p><p>She disrupts the class
</p><p>and ruined
</p><p>today's performance.

</p><p>Lilo? Can you please
</p><p>open the door?
</p><p>Read the note!
</p><p>[groans]
</p><p>I'm sorry I missed
</p><p>your performance.
</p><p>- Pāpā's truck died.
</p><p>- Blah, blah. Wow!
</p><p>That must be
</p><p>so stressful for you.
</p><p>How about you just
</p><p>leave me alone to die?
</p><p>No, no, no. Not now, not now.
</p><p>[horn honks]
</p><p>The social worker is here.
</p><p>You can pout later, Lilo.
</p><p>That's not how pouting works.
</p><p>[Nani] Lilo, open the door.
</p><p>I can't hear you.
</p><p>It's really weird.
</p><p>Open the door
</p><p>or I'm breaking it down!
</p><p>Hey, what is wrong with you?
</p><p>- [clears throat]
</p><p>- Uh...
</p><p>Mrs. Kekoa.
</p><p>Hi. Um, nice to see you.
</p><p>Can I, uh, help you
</p><p>carry anything in?
</p><p>I'm okay. [chuckles]
</p><p>Can I help you
</p><p>carry anything in?
</p><p>Oh, yeah. Would you mind
</p><p>if we just, um,
</p><p>just use the back?
</p><p>It's just, uh, just right--
</p><p>We're in the back.
</p><p>[grunts]
</p><p>[chuckles]
</p><p>These old houses, right?
</p><p>You just gotta have the...
</p><p>the touch!
</p><p>Oh! Oh...
</p><p>There we go! Um... Actually,
</p><p>would you mind waiting here
</p><p>for just a second?
</p><p>- Yes, of course.
</p><p>- Okay.
</p><p>- Hey! Don't touch that.
</p><p>- No, I don't wanna hear it.
</p><p>- That's mine.
</p><p>- I'm turning it off right now.
</p><p>[music stops]
</p><p>So, uh, what can I
</p><p>get you to drink?
</p><p>Do you have tea?
</p><p>Course I have...
</p><p>There's a lot
</p><p>of unpaid bills here, Nani.
</p><p>[groans]
</p><p>How often would you say
</p><p>you leave your little sister
</p><p>home alone?
</p><p>What? No. I... No.
</p><p>Why would I do that? I...
</p><p>I would never leave
</p><p>my sister alone. [chuckles]
</p><p>[Mrs. Kekoa] Smoke, Nani!
</p><p>- Oh! Oh, uh...
</p><p>- The alarm! The smoke alarm!
</p><p>Oh, don't worry.
</p><p>There's no batteries in there.
</p><p>Lilo! [chuckles]
</p><p>I took 'em out
</p><p>because it kept going off.
</p><p>[chuckles] That's not true.
</p><p>Say aloha to Mrs. Kekoa.
</p><p>Aloha, Lilo. How are you?
</p><p>Is that blood?
</p><p>Oh, yeah, I've been practicing
</p><p>jumping out of my window.
</p><p>Ha! She's... She's kidding.
</p><p>She's actually been
</p><p>very well behaved recently.
</p><p>Haven't you, right?
</p><p>[gasps]
</p><p>Yeah,
</p><p>I've been more than good,
</p><p>Mrs. Kekoa.
</p><p>I've been doing very,
</p><p>very great at hula.
</p><p>Made a ton
</p><p>of new friends there,
</p><p>and they all think
</p><p>I'm the coolest.
</p><p>I've been eating
</p><p>a lot of organic stuff.
</p><p>Sometimes I eat too much.
</p><p>And I've been eating
</p><p>five or ten times a day.
</p><p>Sometimes I eat so much, I...
</p><p>can't...
</p><p>- breathe.
</p><p>- [laughs]
</p><p>That's enough imagination
</p><p>for you, you little weirdie.
</p><p>- [microwave dings]
</p><p>- Oh, tea's ready.
</p><p>Hmm. Okay, pretty sweet.
</p><p>Okay, Nani, we both know
</p><p>this didn't go well today.
</p><p>I can see you're trying,
</p><p>but you're too smart for me
</p><p>to beat around the bush here.
</p><p>I know it hasn't
</p><p>been that long
</p><p>since your parents
</p><p>passed away,
</p><p>but my job is to make sure
</p><p>that Lilo is in
</p><p>a stable environment.
</p><p>And I can't say that
</p><p>in good conscience right now.
</p><p>Listen, I know this is a lot.
</p><p>You're practically
</p><p>a kid yourself.
</p><p>[māmā] What happened
</p><p>to knocking?
</p><p>[Lilo and Nani] We decided
</p><p>it was a surf day!
</p><p>- [family cheering, laughing]
</p><p>- [māmā] A surf day?
</p><p>Look, you seem like
</p><p>a goal-oriented person.
</p><p>We have a new director coming
</p><p>into town next week,
</p><p>and I would really,
</p><p>really love to tell him
</p><p>that you girls
</p><p>have turned the corner.
</p><p>So, why don't we come up with
</p><p>some goals to achieve by then?
</p><p>Yeah, yeah.
</p><p>All right, here.
</p><p>Three things.
</p><p>First, I want this house
</p><p>cleaned, including laundry,
</p><p>- and a fully-stocked fridge.
</p><p>- Perfect.
</p><p>Second, pay all those bills
</p><p>I saw in the kitchen.
</p><p>Yes.
</p><p>And third,
</p><p>file for health insurance
</p><p>for you and Lilo.
</p><p>Got it.
</p><p>If you do those three things
</p><p>by Friday,
</p><p>I might be able
</p><p>to give you some more time.
</p><p>Thank you.
</p><p>Okay.
</p><p>It was Capri Sun, yeah?
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>- I figured.
</p><p>[Mrs. Kekoa] And
</p><p>don't forget the insurance.
</p><p>[Nani chuckles]
</p><p>Yeah, yeah. You got it.
</p><p>You're gonna need
</p><p>that health insurance
</p><p>for when I kill you!
</p><p>[screaming]
</p><p>[Nani growls]
</p><p>Oh, yeah.
</p><p>We took out
</p><p>the smoke alarm batteries.
</p><p>I'll show you "can't breathe."
</p><p>Come here!
</p><p>- [screams] Let go of me!
</p><p>- Yeah, no.
</p><p>Ow. Okay.
</p><p>No, no, no.
</p><p>Why didn't you wait at hula?
</p><p>Because you weren't there.
</p><p>Do you want them
</p><p>to split us up?
</p><p>Because that's what's
</p><p>gonna happen
</p><p>if we don't get it together.
</p><p>Hey! Did you just lick me?
</p><p>Stop pretending you're my mom.
</p><p>Oh. At least I don't tell
</p><p>the social worker
</p><p>I like jumping out of windows.
</p><p>It's better
</p><p>than listening to you.
</p><p>Go to your room!
</p><p>I'm already in my room!
</p><p>- [muffled screams]
</p><p>- [screams]
</p><p>[goat screams]
</p><p>Hey, Alvin.
</p><p>[Nani groans]
</p><p>[ATV engine revs up]
</p><p>There she is, Miss Aloha.
</p><p>Yeah, not today she's not.
</p><p>Meeting never go well.
</p><p>I never liked
</p><p>that government lady anyway.
</p><p>Why is she always so smiley?
</p><p>Give me the creeps.
</p><p>Yeah, well,
</p><p>our future is in her hands.
</p><p>Ah, ah. None of that.
</p><p>Your future is in your hands.
</p><p>And you're gonna have
</p><p>a very bright future
</p><p>'cause of that
</p><p>akamai brain of yours.
</p><p>What?
</p><p>Your acceptance letter
</p><p>to your dream school
</p><p>magically taken
</p><p>out of your trash
</p><p>and appearing in your bag
</p><p>at your place of work?
</p><p>Ooh, that's a sign, girl.
</p><p>Will you stop with this?
</p><p>That school is the best school
</p><p>in the whole world
</p><p>for that bionic magnets.
</p><p>Bio... Marine biology.
</p><p>Marine biology.
</p><p>And they already
</p><p>let you in once,
</p><p>and they wanted
</p><p>to give you for full ride.
</p><p>Yeah, I know, but, Tūtū,
</p><p>there's no way.
</p><p>Lilo needs me here.
</p><p>You ever ask Lilo
</p><p>what she wants?
</p><p>She's six, so, no.
</p><p>Sorry, Tūtū.
</p><p>Had to catch a few extra ones.
</p><p>The swell was... Hey, Nani!
</p><p>What are you doing here?
</p><p>[Nani] I live here.
</p><p>We're neighbors.
</p><p>[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah,
</p><p>that's... that's good. Uh...
</p><p>The waves were crazy today.
</p><p>You know, I was like,
</p><p>"Nani should be here,"
</p><p>'cause you're always, like,
</p><p>shredding waves,
</p><p>and I miss shredding you.
</p><p>I mean, I miss...
</p><p>I miss seeing you
</p><p>shred waves, so...
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>I've always loved
</p><p>watching you.
</p><p>- Not to say that--
</p><p>- Well said, David.
</p><p>- Well.
</p><p>- [David] So, like, when...
</p><p>when are you gonna go surfing?
</p><p>[Nani]
</p><p>Maybe when Lilo turns 18.
</p><p>Enjoy the surf.
</p><p>Bebeh.
</p><p>Now, make up
</p><p>with your sister, yeah?
</p><p>You need anything,
</p><p>you just ask, okay?
</p><p>We're not just neighbors,
</p><p>you know.
</p><p>We're ʻohana.
</p><p>[ATV engine revs up]
</p><p>- Yeah, I mean, if you want--
</p><p>- No, no!
</p><p>No, David, you've said enough.
</p><p>[speaking indistinctly]
</p><p>[space ship rumbling]
</p><p>- [alarm beeping]
</p><p>- [computer] Warning.
</p><p>- Check engine.
</p><p>- Hmm? [grunts]
</p><p>[beeping stops]
</p><p>- [alarm beeping]
</p><p>- Warning. Check engine.
</p><p>[beeping stops]
</p><p>- [computer] Warning. Guidan--
</p><p>- [grunting]
</p><p>[chuckles, sighs]
</p><p>- [alarms blaring]
</p><p>- Guidance not functional.
</p><p>Warning. Guidance not
</p><p>functional. Warning.
</p><p>Warning.
</p><p>Guidance not functional.
</p><p>Crash imminent.
</p><p>Prepare for impact.
</p><p>[speaking Tantalog]
</p><p>[screams]
</p><p>[knocking on door]
</p><p>Hey. Think I might've nailed
</p><p>those kalua sliders you like.
</p><p>Here.
</p><p>[groans]
</p><p>You don't have to eat it.
</p><p>Nani, am I bad?
</p><p>What?
</p><p>That's what everyone says.
</p><p>Nobody says that.
</p><p>Maybe some teachers
</p><p>and school security guards.
</p><p>Look, you're not bad.
</p><p>You just do
</p><p>bad things sometimes.
</p><p>Just like me earlier,
</p><p>when I yelled at you.
</p><p>We just have to learn
</p><p>from our mistakes.
</p><p>I shoved Mertle Edmonds today.
</p><p>I know.
</p><p>You wanna tell me
</p><p>what happened?
</p><p>People treat me different.
</p><p>[sighs] Baby, they just...
</p><p>They just don't know
</p><p>what to say.
</p><p>But you...
</p><p>you didn't mean what you said,
</p><p>did you?
</p><p>No. Of course not.
</p><p>You're my sister.
</p><p>And I'll always be here
</p><p>for you. Okay?
</p><p>You got that?
</p><p>No more tickle town.
</p><p>Yes, tickle town.
</p><p>Yes, tickle town.
</p><p>- Tickle town!
</p><p>- I don't wanna go!
</p><p>[Lilo] Will you still

</p><p>Aren't you just

</p><p>It has been 24 hours. Have you

</p><p>Start.
</p><p>Start traveling, please.
</p><p>We've captured his attention.
</p><p>Oh, his attention. Good.
</p><p>There's no...
</p><p>There's no instruments.
</p><p>There's nothing here!
</p><p>And are you
</p><p>enjoying the hotel?
</p><p>[Pleakley] I'm so glad
</p><p>you asked. I mean--
</p><p>I'm obviously being sarcastic.
</p><p>- Go! Systems go.
</p><p>- Hey!

</p><p>- Oh, no. Other way.
</p><p>- What you think you're doing?
</p><p>Find the creature.
</p><p>And remember,
</p><p>you must use discretion.
</p><p>- Discretion is my middle name.
</p><p>- How do I stop this thing?
</p><p>Oh, brilliant.
</p><p>Is it too late
</p><p>to vaporize the planet?

</p><p>Where'd you get

</p><p>This is our last shot.
</p><p>If I don't find a job
</p><p>by today...

</p><p>Okay, wish me luck.
</p><p>Okay, Stitch,

</p><p>So let's get to work.
</p><p>Ready? Sit.
</p><p>[grunts]
</p><p>[chuckles]
</p><p>[Lilo] Okay, class, listen up.
</p><p>This is your badness level.
</p><p>It's unusually high
</p><p>for someone your size.
</p><p>- But we'll fix that.
</p><p>- [grumbles]
</p><p>So, lesson number one.
</p><p>Lend a helping hand.
</p><p>Or a paw.
</p><p>- [chattering]
</p><p>- [Lilo] This is how you clean.
</p><p>First, use this.

</p><p>Up, up, up, up, up, up.
</p><p>Call an ambulance!
</p><p>[groaning]
</p><p>Well, folks.
</p><p>She asked if she could ride
</p><p>in the MRI machine.
</p><p>I told her
</p><p>I would check with you.
</p><p>[sighs] She's fine.
</p><p>[chuckles]
</p><p>- [Stitch sighs]
</p><p>- She got lucky.
</p><p>A few more seconds,
</p><p>it could've been much worse.
</p><p>But, overall...
</p><p>Is that a--
</p><p>It's a service animal.
</p><p>Okay.
</p><p>And you can see the front.
</p><p>They'll run your insurance.
</p><p>Okay?
</p><p>Mahalo.
</p><p>Uh-oh. What?
</p><p>[Nani] No. No. Absolutely not.
</p><p>It's not just the bills, Nani.
</p><p>It's time for you to think
</p><p>about what's best for Lilo.
</p><p>There's a way that the state
</p><p>will pay for all of this.
</p><p>But...
</p><p>it means that you have
</p><p>to officially relinquish...
</p><p>guardianship of Lilo.
</p><p>What would that...
</p><p>look like? Um...
</p><p>Well, we take our lead
</p><p>from you.
</p><p>You tell us
</p><p>how you want to proceed.
</p><p>It's really about making the
</p><p>transition easier for Lilo.
</p><p>[Mrs. Kekoa]
</p><p>You'll still get to see her.
</p><p>It'll just be different.
</p><p>You can prepare a bag,
</p><p>a few toys,
</p><p>things that comfort her.
</p><p>And at that point,
</p><p>we would leave you
</p><p>some time alone to...
</p><p>Say goodbye.
</p><p>No.
</p><p>We don't say goodbye.
</p><p>We say a hui hou.

</p><p>Until we meet again.
</p><p>I really thought
</p><p>they could make it work.

</p><p>protect her like that?
</p><p>[Pleakley] You don't think
</p><p>they're kind of cute together?
</p><p>He's not a pet.
</p><p>He's an experiment.
</p><p>And a dangerous one at that.
</p><p>I just think he's a lot cuter
</p><p>than you think
</p><p>he is dangerous.
</p><p>He has sharp teeth.
</p><p>He has claws.
</p><p>I designed him
</p><p>to be dangerous.

</p><p>Oh, you're learning the--
</p><p>[shrieks]
</p><p>I really thought
</p><p>we were getting closer.
</p><p>[Jumba]
</p><p>It's time to do this my way.
</p><p>Oh, no.
</p><p>Hey, boo thang.
</p><p>Hey.
</p><p>What are you doing, silly?
</p><p>Oh, I'm just playing with my
</p><p>dolls that I made at Tūtū's.
</p><p>- Aw, cute.
</p><p>- Pizza!
</p><p>[Nani chuckles]
</p><p>[chuckles] Um...
</p><p>So, remember that time
</p><p>that I went to the North Shore
</p><p>that one summer?
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>And we were on
</p><p>opposite sides of the island,
</p><p>but we could, you know,
</p><p>go and visit
</p><p>anytime we wanted, right?
</p><p>We just weren't together
</p><p>all the time.
</p><p>But we could call.
</p><p>You would tell me about all
</p><p>of your fun little adventures
</p><p>with Alvin and Tūtū
</p><p>and stuff like that.
</p><p>And we could talk a lot,
</p><p>just not all the time.
</p><p>You know?
</p><p>Is this... [sighs]
</p><p>Is this connecting at all?
</p><p>You're going back
</p><p>to surf camp?
</p><p>No. No.
</p><p>It's just that with Stitch
</p><p>and everything this week,
</p><p>things have gone
</p><p>from bad to worse, so...
</p><p>we're gonna have to make
</p><p>some changes.
</p><p>And...
</p><p>You know... I...
</p><p>I have to get some air.
</p><p>[sighs softly]
</p><p>Remember when Pāpā
</p><p>took us camping out here?
</p><p>- [chuckles] What?
</p><p>- Yeah, remember?
</p><p>I had s'mores.
</p><p>And you also did too.
</p><p>Pāpā didn't take us camping.
</p><p>They were fumigating.
</p><p>We had termites.
</p><p>Mmm. I went camping.
</p><p>We had fun.
</p><p>They were really good parents.
</p><p>Hey.
</p><p>I changed my mind.
</p><p>What's that?
</p><p>Hmm?
</p><p>I like you as a mom too.
</p><p>Come on. Do it. For me?
</p><p>Okay.

</p><p>[screaming]
</p><p>- Come on!
</p><p>- Cool.
</p><p>[Lilo]
</p><p>You're a genius, Stitch.
</p><p>[Jumba] I made him.
</p><p>I'm the genius!
</p><p>[Lilo screams]

</p><p>[groans]
</p><p>This is all my fault.
</p><p>[motor whirring]
</p><p>Hui.
</p><p>[screaming]
</p><p>[grunts]
</p><p>Ugh! And now I have a wedgie.
</p><p>[pizza clerk] Wait. Why would
</p><p>I know where you sister is?
</p><p>I don't know. This is the only
</p><p>phone number I could find.
</p><p>Do you wanna order
</p><p>a pepperoni or what?
</p><p>[gasps] Never mind.
</p><p>She's back.
</p><p>Nani!
</p><p>[gasps]
</p><p>Nani!
</p><p>Stitch, stop.
</p><p>[shushes]
</p><p>Ow.
</p><p>Okay, 626, very clever trick.
</p><p>Funny. I got to stare
</p><p>at my own derriere.
</p><p>I've always wanted to do that.
</p><p>[Lilo] What are you doing?
</p><p>- [Lilo gasps]
</p><p>- Okay, listen.
</p><p>I... I just wanna say...
</p><p>the Federation
</p><p>doesn't exactly appreciate
</p><p>what you've done here.
</p><p>I know you're in there.
</p><p>Come out, please.
</p><p>I've got huge plans for you.
</p><p>I mean, for us.
</p><p>Go away, hairy potato!
</p><p>Did you just call me
</p><p>a hairy potato?
</p><p>That's not nice.
</p><p>Window, window, window!
</p><p>- [shrieks]
</p><p>- Wait! Come back!
</p><p>Hey! You're gonna run?
</p><p>You're not gonna run away
</p><p>from all this.
</p><p>All these memories.
</p><p>Humans are so attached
</p><p>to each other.
</p><p>To their things,
</p><p>to the alien experiments
</p><p>they've stolen from me.
</p><p>[Stitch] We gotta go!
</p><p>"Attachment" means you care.
</p><p>- [Stitch] Hurry!
</p><p>- Oh, no.
</p><p>[gasps] Lilo! Hurry!
</p><p>We go now!
</p><p>And caring causes people
</p><p>to make very stupid decisions.
</p><p>Who is "May-May"
</p><p>and "Pay-Pay?"
</p><p>That's Māmā and Pāpā's room.
</p><p>Oh! That makes
</p><p>a lot more sense.
</p><p>Stop it, or else.
</p><p>Or else what?
</p><p>What are you gonna do?
</p><p>[Stitch] Yoo-hoo.
</p><p>- [chuckles]
</p><p>- [Jumba] There he is.
</p><p>Aloha! [chuckles]
</p><p>[shrieks]
</p><p>[panting]
</p><p>- I'm sorry.
</p><p>- [screams]
</p><p>[screaming]
</p><p>My eye! My eye! My eye!
</p><p>Why would you do that?
</p><p>[shrieks]
</p><p>Hey, stop it.
</p><p>I'm only trying to help!
</p><p>[groans]
</p><p>626, playtime is over.
</p><p>[screams]
</p><p>Ow!
</p><p>Ah!
</p><p>[slurping]
</p><p>Okay, okay, okay.
</p><p>What's the plan, 626?
</p><p>Say you escape the Federation.
</p><p>You think you're gonna
</p><p>just stay here with her?
</p><p>Live happily ever after
</p><p>on Earth?
</p><p>You're built to destroy, 626,
</p><p>and you have.
</p><p>Look what's happened
</p><p>since you got here.
</p><p>Her family is falling apart.
</p><p>Let's just be honest.
</p><p>The only reason you picked her
</p><p>at that animal shelter
</p><p>was for your own protection.
</p><p>Is that true, Stitch?
</p><p>See, I don't think that's bad.
</p><p>I don't think anything
</p><p>you do is bad.
</p><p>I think it's genius.
</p><p>If you care about
</p><p>this little girl at all,
</p><p>you'll leave her here.
</p><p>[sighing]
</p><p>Stitch?
</p><p>[portal burbles]
</p><p>Aw.
</p><p>This is for the best.
</p><p>Lilo, run!
</p><p>David, Nani, meet me
</p><p>back at the house.
</p><p>[Jumba] You know,
</p><p>you made the right choice.
</p><p>The Councilwoman
</p><p>was gonna exile you.
</p><p>She was gonna waste
</p><p>all my brilliant science.
</p><p>But I'm gonna do something
</p><p>even better.
</p><p>- [device beeps]
</p><p>- [gasps]
</p><p>And turn you into 627.
</p><p>[gasps]
</p><p>- [David] Lilo?
</p><p>- Lilo!
</p><p>- Lilo!
</p><p>- Not in here.
</p><p>- I'm gonna check the back.
</p><p>- Okay.
</p><p>- What happened?
</p><p>- I don't know.
</p><p>- Where's Lilo?
</p><p>- I don't know.
</p><p>She's not here.
</p><p>Actually, she's on a ship
</p><p>headed away from the--
</p><p>[all screaming]
</p><p>Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
</p><p>That was a really
</p><p>impressive throw.
</p><p>If we can all...
</p><p>No, come on.
</p><p>Not that again. I actually...
</p><p>Agent Cobra Bubbles, CIA.
</p><p>- [Pleakley] What?
</p><p>- Wait, what? CIA?
</p><p>Wendell Pleakley from the
</p><p>United Galactic Federation.
</p><p>I'm a fellow
</p><p>government worker.
</p><p>What you doing here?
</p><p>- Yeah, where is my sister?
</p><p>- Great news.
</p><p>She's alive and well.
</p><p>Well, actually,
</p><p>I don't know if she's well.
</p><p>This only tells me
</p><p>the velocity
</p><p>of them moving away
</p><p>from the planet.
</p><p>Enough! I'm taking you out,
</p><p>and that's that. Let's go.
</p><p>You know, seeing you with that
</p><p>little girl made me realize
</p><p>you're not the heartless
</p><p>monster I thought you were.
</p><p>But once I remove
</p><p>your capacity for love,
</p><p>you'll be perfect.
</p><p>And then, with 627 by my side,
</p><p>the Councilwoman
</p><p>won't be able to stop me.
</p><p>[laughs]
</p><p>Oh, don't look so sad, 626.
</p><p>We have each other.
</p><p>I'm your "o'hannah,"
</p><p>just like your friend Lisa
</p><p>used to say.
</p><p>Was that her name, Lisa? Lily?
</p><p>Limo? Limo... No.
</p><p>- What was her name?
</p><p>- Lilo!
</p><p>Oh, yeah, that was it. Lilo.
</p><p>Horrible name. Let's get
</p><p>off this planet, huh?
</p><p>[spaceship voice]
</p><p>Initiating hyperspeed.
</p><p>Ready to launch
</p><p>in two minutes.
</p><p>You need to tell me
</p><p>what is going on.
</p><p>- Where is my sister?
</p><p>- Not now.
</p><p>The priority is reporting
</p><p>this incident
</p><p>and getting this thing
</p><p>into custody.
</p><p>People need to know what
</p><p>kind of threat they're under.
</p><p>Uh, I'm not really a threat.
</p><p>I'm kinda quite harmless, actually.
</p><p>But you shouldn't be
</p><p>that concerned.
</p><p>This is actually
</p><p>my first mission
</p><p>in the field,
</p><p>so I wouldn't really
</p><p>- be that concerned. Okay.
</p><p>- [Nani] Wait, wait.
</p><p>Aren't you supposed
</p><p>to protect us?
</p><p>I took an oath to protect
</p><p>the American people.
</p><p>Hey. What you think we are?
</p><p>[Agent Foster] Cobra, you were
</p><p>right. The lab results are in,
</p><p>and we've never seen
</p><p>anything like this.
</p><p>Please.
</p><p>There is something big
</p><p>at play here.
</p><p>Have you found any
</p><p>additional evidence?
</p><p>[Nani] She's my sister. He's
</p><p>the only one who can help.
</p><p>- Hmm.
</p><p>- Okay.
</p><p>Also, I took off
</p><p>your bracelets.
</p><p>They were uncomfortable.
</p><p>Yeah, it just comes down
</p><p>to having a vision.
</p><p>That's all science is.
</p><p>- It's the ability...
</p><p>- Red button.
</p><p>- ...to see what others can't.
</p><p>- Push. Go.
</p><p>And I'm guilty of that.
</p><p>The Grand Councilwoman,
</p><p>for example...
</p><p>No. No, no, no.
</p><p>...she couldn't see the future
</p><p>if it were standing
</p><p>right in front of her.
</p><p>Oh, I wouldn't say that
</p><p>to her face.
</p><p>[groaning]
</p><p>[power whirs]
</p><p>Hey! What are you doing?
</p><p>Hey, 626, don't touch
</p><p>those wi--
</p><p>Hey!
</p><p>Do not touch another wire.
</p><p>- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
</p><p>- [Jumba] Please.
</p><p>I mean,
</p><p>it's really frustrating
</p><p>to have this relationship
</p><p>with you.
</p><p>I say something,
</p><p>you ignore it.
</p><p>When we get back,
</p><p>there's gonna be
</p><p>some real changes.
</p><p>Not so fast, pizza face.
</p><p>[buzzing]
</p><p>Huh? What the...
</p><p>[wipers squeaking]
</p><p>[gasps] Lisa.

</p><p>What?

</p><p>that your little friend
</p><p>is a dangerous,

</p><p>As for experiment 62--

</p><p>My name Stitch.

</p><p>Yes.

</p><p>I found it all on my own.
</p><p>It's little and broken,
</p><p>but still good.
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>Still good.
</p><p>[Pleakley] Grand Councilwoman,
</p><p>can we leave Stitch
</p><p>with his new family?
</p><p>Absolutely not.
</p><p>The Council would
</p><p>require supervision.
</p><p>And who would possibly
</p><p>want to stay
</p><p>on this dilapidated
</p><p>mosquito farm?
</p><p>- Me, me. Me! Me!
</p><p>- [Grand Councilwoman] Ha!
</p><p>Ridiculous.
</p><p>I cannot risk the global panic
</p><p>that would ensue
</p><p>if this were to become public.
</p><p>[Cobra] What if it didn't?
</p><p>Oh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah!
</p><p>He's CIA. He's very good

</p><p>Our reconnaissance said
</p><p>you were going to tell
</p><p>your superiors about this.
</p><p>How could I ever trust you
</p><p>to keep it a secret?
</p><p>[Cobra] Your Highness...
</p><p>you have my word.
</p><p>[Grand Councilwoman] Hmm.
</p><p>You have all shown me
</p><p>that there is good
</p><p>in this creature.
</p><p>However, I cannot reverse
</p><p>the council's decision.
</p><p>Experiment 626 has been
</p><p>sentenced to life in exile.
</p><p>A sentence that will be
</p><p>henceforth served
</p><p>here on Earth.
</p><p>[Tūtū, Nani gasp]
</p><p>[Lilo chuckling]
</p><p>Yay! [chuckles]
</p><p>Lilo.
</p><p>[gasps] I'm so happy.
</p><p>Permission to hug
</p><p>the Grand Councilwoman?
</p><p>- Still no.
</p><p>- Of course. Yeah.
</p><p>We will be checking in
</p><p>now and then.
</p><p>- Let's go home.
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>- Come on, Stitch.
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>[hammer banging]
</p><p>[David] Hey,
</p><p>look on the bright side,
</p><p>there were a lot of good
</p><p>memories in this house.
</p><p>- Some good.
</p><p>- [glass shatters]
</p><p>Some bad.
</p><p>This one's kind of bad. Yeah.
</p><p>At least
</p><p>you got the wind chimes.
</p><p>That's crazy.
</p><p>Um, David?
</p><p>[David] Hmm?
</p><p>Read the room.
</p><p>[Stitch, Nani chuckle]
</p><p>He is right though.
</p><p>[Mrs. Kekoa] Nani.
</p><p>Hey, baby...
</p><p>I need to talk to you
</p><p>about something.
</p><p>I know. This doesn't
</p><p>change our agreement.
</p><p>Well, actually...
</p><p>Oh, no. What's wrong?
</p><p>[Tūtū] Nothing.
</p><p>Well, actually, plenty.
</p><p>Your house is destroyed.
</p><p>Your dog is an alien.
</p><p>Our baby about to go
</p><p>to another ʻohana.
</p><p>But that's what
</p><p>we've been talking about.
</p><p>What if Lilo came
</p><p>to live with us?
</p><p>Ooh.
</p><p>No, Tūtū, that is
</p><p>way too much.
</p><p>- That is...
</p><p>- [shushes]
</p><p>Smiley already said yes.
</p><p>It is usually
</p><p>a much easier transition
</p><p>in these foster situations
</p><p>if the family, hanai
</p><p>or otherwise, are involved.
</p><p>[Nani] I mean...
</p><p>Tūtū, that would be amazing.
</p><p>I mean, after we rebuild...
</p><p>You'd be right next door.
</p><p>Really?
</p><p>[Lilo] No.
</p><p>You're so smart, Nani.
</p><p>I think
</p><p>you should join the Marines.
</p><p>[chuckles] Baby,
</p><p>it's marine biology.
</p><p>No. I, uh...
</p><p>It's a lot more complicated
</p><p>than that.
</p><p>But I want you to go.
</p><p>And plus, that's what Māmā
</p><p>and Pāpā would like too.
</p><p>They told me so.
</p><p>[sighs] Yeah, but, Lilo...
</p><p>it's my kuleana
</p><p>to take care of you.
</p><p>Nobody gets left behind.
</p><p>[Tūtū] It's also your kuleana
</p><p>to make sure
</p><p>you no leave yourself behind.
</p><p>Look at what
</p><p>your parents gave you.
</p><p>A good head on your shoulders.
</p><p>A sense of place.
</p><p>Pride. An akamai brain.
</p><p>A creative spirit.
</p><p>But most important,
</p><p>you get each other.
</p><p>ʻOhana.
</p><p>- [Stitch sighs]
</p><p>- Use them.
</p><p>Make us proud.
</p><p>[Nani chuckles]
</p><p>- Come here.
</p><p>- I love you.
</p><p>[Nani] I love you too.
</p><p>[gasps] Nani, maybe college
</p><p>can teach you how to cook!
</p><p>[Tūtū] Okay, okay.
</p><p>Come on, Smiley.
</p><p>- [Nani] Come here.
</p><p>- [Tūtū] Get in here.
